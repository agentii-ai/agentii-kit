---

## 3. Core Problems & Jobs-to-be-Done *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Focus on problems PAINFUL enough to drive organic Twitter conversation
  and CLEAR enough to turn into threads, demos, and daily content.
-->

### Top Problems Today

**Problem 1: "The Agony Problem"** *(for threads/rants)*
- **What is slow, tedious, expensive, or error-prone?**
  [Describe the pain point]
- **Existing Twitter evidence**:
  [Link to real tweets/threads showing this complaint, or describe the pattern]
- **Twitter format for this**:
  "The old way vs. The new way" side-by-side comparison

**Problem 2**: [Describe second major pain point]

**Problem 3**: [Describe third pain point, if applicable]

---

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

For each problem above, write 1-2 JTBD statements:

**JTBD-1**:
> "When [situation], I want to [job], so I can [outcome]."

**Twitter Demo Idea**:
[1-2 ideas for a thread, demo clip, or before/after story]

**JTBD-2**:
> "When [situation], I want to [job], so I can [outcome]."

**Twitter Demo Idea**:

### Existing Alternatives

**Current Solutions**: [What tools/workflows do they use today?]

**Twitter Sentiment**: [How do users talk about these alternatives - praise, frustrations, memes, feature requests?]

**Gap to Exploit**: [Clear gap between what existing tools promise vs. what persona actually experiences]

---

## 4. Hero Workflows & Irrefutable Demos *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Define the FIRST WEDGE and HERO WORKFLOWS - narrow and high-value.
  Map workflows directly into content and demo strategy.

  CRITICAL: Your product scope must be defined by what can be demoed
  convincingly in a 30-60s video.
-->

### Single Wedge Use Case

**Use Case**: [One clearly defined use case where product becomes the default tool]

**Twitter Quotable** *(10-20 words)*:
> "[Product] is the easiest way for [persona] to [job] without [annoying thing]."

---

### Hero Workflow (End-to-End)

**Workflow Steps** *(5-8 concrete steps)*:
1. [User intent/input]
2. [AI-assisted work]
3. [Intermediate step]
4. [Output/outcome]
5. [Shareable artifact]

**For Each Step**:
- **15-60s "Irrefutable Demo" Clip**: [What would the video show?]
- **Before/After Metrics**: [Speed, quality, volume, cost reduction - screenshot-worthy]

---

### The "Irrefutable Demo" Checklist

- [ ] **Starts in media res** (no login screens, no setup)
- [ ] **Speed is transparent** (if accelerated, mark "x2 speed" in corner)
- [ ] **Output is production-ready** (not "hello world" toy demo)
- [ ] **Time-to-Wow < 15 seconds**
- [ ] **Demonstrates "magic" outcome** that feels impossible

---

### Content-Ready Workflows & UGC Strategy

**Shareable Workflows** *(2-3 workflows that produce shareable artifacts)*:
1. [Workflow that naturally creates clips, screenshots, charts, comparisons]
2. [Workflow with side-by-side before/after]
3. [Workflow producing inherently shareable output]

**UGC Framing**:
- **Hashtag**: [e.g., #BuiltWith[Product]]
- **Encourage phrase**: [e.g., "We asked [Product] to...", "Watch [Product] do [task]"]

---

### Out-of-Scope (For Now)

**Not Targeting**:
- [Adjacent use cases deliberately excluded in first Twitter phase]
- [Personas you're not targeting yet]

**Polite "Not Yet" Response** *(one-line answer for Twitter)*:
> "[Feature X] is on the roadmap, but we're laser-focused on [hero workflow] first."

---

## 5. Desired Outcomes & Value Proposition *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Describe "10x better" in ways that can be PROVEN in screenshots,
  threads, and user stories.
-->

### Functional Outcome

**New Capability**:
[What can they now do that they couldn't before?]

**Workflow Unlock**:
[Which workflows become realistically possible for smaller teams/individuals?]

**Twitter Proof Format**:

---

### Efficiency Outcome: "The Unfair Advantage"

**Time Savings**:
> "Cuts [Task] from [X hours] to [Y minutes]."

**Cost Reduction**:
[Reduction in agencies, contractors, tools spend]

**"Wall Street Secret" Claim**:
[Concrete, data-backed claim suitable for viral hooks]

---

### Quality Outcome: "Show Your Work"

**Fewer Errors**: [How product reduces mistakes, bugs, inconsistencies]

**Consistency**: [Better adherence to brand/standards/policies]

**Transparency**: [How you show citations, reasoning traces, comparisons to avoid over-promising]

---

### Emotional Outcome: "The Flow State Promise"

**Feeling Change**:
[How does product change how users FEEL - anxiety→confidence, boring→creative, overwhelmed→in-control]

**Aspirational Quote** *(1-2 emotional stories you'd love to see in the wild)*:
> "I'd be very disappointed if this disappeared."
> "This finally makes [job] feel doable as a solo founder."

---

## 6. Twitter Signals & Success Metrics *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Forget follower counts. Focus on USER BEHAVIOR and BUSINESS OUTCOMES,
  specifically signal quality from target personas.
-->

- **Founder account**: [posts/threads per week]
- **Product account**: [posts/threads per week]
- **Target engagement rate**: [from ideal customer profiles, not general followers]

---

### High-Quality Signal Metrics

**Quote-Tweet Ratio**:
[High QTs with "Wait, is this real?" or "I need this" > High Likes]
