# Twitter Execution Tasks: [CAMPAIGN NAME]

**Input**: Campaign plan from `/specs/[###-campaign-name]/plan.md`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), constitution.md (recommended)

**Methodology**: Tasks follow **PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act)** sprint cycles. Break work into 2-week sprints synchronized with product updates.

---

## Task Execution Methodology

This twitter-init-kit project treats Twitter growth like engineering: **structured sprints, clear ownership, shipping criteria**.

### The PDCA Loop (2-Week Sprint Cycle)

- **Plan (Monday, Week 1)**: Define "Sprint Narrative" (e.g., "Focus on Speed value prop"), draft core threads, identify "Hero Feature" to demo
- **Do (Week 1-2)**: Execute content calendar, run outreach, ship growth triggers
- **Check (Friday, Week 2)**: Review metrics. Did "Speed" narrative drive higher conversion than previous "Quality" narrative?
- **Act (Weekend)**: Update spec.md with learnings. Kill underperforming formats. Double down on winners for next sprint.

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Foundation (Weeks 0-2)
