# How Leading Investment Banks Use Agentii for Due Diligence

M&A due diligence is one of the most time-intensive and critical processes in investment banking. A single deal can involve hundreds of documents, thousands of pages, and weeks of analyst time. Leading investment banks are now using Agentii to transform this process, reducing analysis time from weeks to days while improving accuracy and consistency.

## The Challenge

Traditional due diligence processes face several challenges:

### Volume and Complexity
A typical M&A deal involves:
- 200-500 documents
- 1,000-5,000 pages of financial statements, contracts, and reports
- Multiple data sources (CRM, ERP, legal documents)
- Tight deadlines (often 2-4 weeks)

### Manual Analysis Limitations
- **Time-consuming**: Analysts spend 60-80% of their time on data extraction
- **Error-prone**: Manual data entry leads to inconsistencies
- **Incomplete**: Important details can be missed in large document sets
- **Inconsistent**: Different analysts may interpret data differently

### Quality and Compliance
- Regulatory requirements demand thorough documentation
- Stakeholders need confidence in analysis quality
- Audit trails must be comprehensive and traceable

## The Solution: Agentii Intelligence Hub

Investment banks are deploying Agentii's Intelligence Hub to automate and enhance their due diligence workflows. Here's how it works:

### 1. Document Processing

**Before Agentii:**
- Analysts manually review each document
- Extract data into spreadsheets
- Cross-reference information across documents
- Time: 2-3 weeks for a typical deal

**With Agentii:**
- Upload all documents to Intelligence Hub
- AI agents automatically extract structured data
- Cross-references and relationships are identified automatically
- Time: 2-3 days for the same deal

### 2. Financial Analysis

Agentii's specialized financial analysis agents:
- Extract key metrics (revenue, EBITDA, margins, growth rates)
- Calculate financial ratios and benchmarks
- Identify trends and anomalies
- Compare performance across time periods

### 3. Risk Assessment

Automated risk assessment agents:
- Flag potential compliance issues
- Identify unusual transactions or patterns
- Assess financial health indicators
- Generate risk scorecards

### 4. Report Generation

Comprehensive reports are automatically generated including:
- Executive summary
- Financial analysis
- Risk assessment
- Key findings and recommendations
- Full audit trail
