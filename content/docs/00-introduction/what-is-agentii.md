# What is Agentii?

Agentii is an AI-powered research platform designed for institutional financial analysis. It accelerates financial analysis by enabling AI agents to simultaneously evaluate complex documents, perform multiple valuation methodologies, and synthesize insights—work that traditionally requires hours of manual research.

## How Agentii Fits Your Workflow

If you're familiar with Bloomberg Terminal or FactSet, think of Agentii as a complementary layer on top of those tools. Where traditional terminals excel at real-time market data and standardized metrics, Agentii excels at:

- **Multi-document synthesis**: Analyzing 10-Ks, earnings transcripts, research reports, and expert insights simultaneously
- **Concurrent analysis**: Running DCF, comparable company, and precedent transaction valuations in parallel
- **Rapid iteration**: Asking follow-up questions and refining analysis in real time
- **Methodology validation**: Cross-checking conclusions across different analytical approaches

### Example: Pre-Earnings Analysis

**Traditional workflow** (3-4 hours):
1. Review analyst consensus estimates manually
2. Calculate your own DCF model
3. Analyze historical earnings surprises
4. Synthesize findings into thesis

**Agentii workflow** (30 minutes):
1. Create a project with three agents: Retrieval (fetch consensus), Valuation (run DCF), Risk (evaluate surprise factors)
2. Agents work in parallel
3. Review results, cross-check conclusions, refine thesis
4. Spend time on judgment and decision-making, not data gathering

## Two Ways to Use Agentii

Agentii provides two complementary interfaces for different research styles:

### Intelligence Hub: Project-Based Analysis
**For structured research campaigns** (earnings studies, sector rotations, M&A screening)

- Create projects organizing analysis around stocks or sectors
- Structure analysis into phases (pre-earnings, post-earnings, quarterly updates)
- Configure agents with specific prompts and instructions
- Monitor task progress and manage multiple parallel analyses
- Export results for presentations, reports, and sharing

**When to use Hub**: Planning comprehensive multi-week analyses, managing team workflows, building institutional knowledge

### Agent Workbench: Real-Time Exploration
**For exploratory, conversational analysis** (quick stock research, thesis validation, competitive intelligence)

- Submit natural language questions
- Agents respond immediately with relevant findings
- Ask follow-up questions and explore tangents
- Share sessions with colleagues
- Export transcripts for records

**When to use Workbench**: Quick 5-minute stock checks, diving deeper into unexpected results, testing new ideas

## What Agentii Cannot Do

Agentii is powerful but not a substitute for judgment. Understanding its limitations is essential:

- **No predictions**: Agents analyze historical and current information; they don't predict stock prices or predict future events
- **No portfolio management**: Agentii provides analysis; you make portfolio decisions
- **No replacement for compliance**: All agent output requires human review before use in client recommendations or investor decisions
- **No proprietary algorithms**: Agents use standard financial methodologies (DCF, comps, etc.); they don't employ secret strategies

## Key Use Cases

Agentii accelerates analysis across multiple financial domains:

### Equity Research
- **Initiating coverage** on new stocks: Multi-dimensional analysis in hours, not weeks
- **Earnings analysis**: Compare analyst consensus, historical patterns, and DCF scenarios simultaneously
- **Competitive analysis**: Analyze peer companies and their positioning at scale
- **Thesis monitoring**: Regular surveillance of key risk factors across your coverage

### Credit Analysis
- **Rating implications**: Analyze covenant adherence, leverage trends, credit metrics
- **Refinancing risk**: Evaluate maturity ladder, market conditions, refinancing capacity
- **Sector trends**: Monitor industry dynamics affecting credit profiles

### Merger & Acquisition
- **Target screening**: Rapid multi-dimensional assessment of acquisition candidates
- **Valuation analysis**: Compare multiple valuation approaches to establish pricing range
- **Integration planning**: Analyze synergy opportunities and risks

### Portfolio Management
- **Risk factor analysis**: Systematic evaluation of portfolio exposures to identified risks
- **Attribution analysis**: Understand which factors drove performance
- **Rebalancing**: Data-driven recommendations based on thesis changes

## Who Uses Agentii

Agentii serves different roles in financial institutions:

- **Equity research analysts**: Accelerate research velocity without compromising depth
- **Portfolio managers**: Validate investment theses and monitor risks efficiently
- **Credit analysts**: Evaluate credit metrics and refinancing scenarios
- **Investment bankers**: Screen targets, model valuations, assess strategic fit
- **Risk managers**: Monitor portfolio exposures and scenario test
- **Compliance teams**: Maintain documentation and audit trails

## Expected Learning Curve

Agentii is designed for financial professionals, so learning is quick:

- **15 minutes**: Create your first project, see agents in action
- **1 hour**: Complete first analysis end-to-end (Workbench query or Hub task)
- **1 day**: Comfortable with both Hub and Workbench interfaces
- **1 week**: Proficient with agent configuration, multi-agent orchestration
- **4 weeks**: Expert user, optimizing workflows, building team practices

No technical background required. If you're comfortable with Bloomberg Terminal or FactSet, you'll be productive in Agentii quickly.
