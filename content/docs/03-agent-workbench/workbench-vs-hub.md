# Workbench vs Intelligence Hub: Decision Framework

Agentii provides two distinct but complementary platforms for AI-powered financial analysis. Choosing the optimal tool for your analytical needs directly impacts research efficiency, collaboration effectiveness, and decision quality. This framework helps institutional analysts make strategic platform choices that align with their research objectives and workflow requirements.

## Platform Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Agent Workbench | Intelligence Hub |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Primary Use Case** | Real-time, conversational analysis | Structured, project-based research |
| **Analysis Style** | Exploratory, iterative | Systematic, comprehensive |
| **Time Horizon** | Immediate insights (minutes to hours) | Extended research (days to weeks) |
| **Documentation** | Session transcripts | Formal project reports |
| **Collaboration** | Individual analyst focus | Team collaboration and coordination |
| **Output Format** | Conversation threads | Structured deliverables |
| **Context Persistence** | Session-based memory | Project-wide integration |
| **Agent Orchestration** | Sequential within sessions | Parallel across tasks |
| **Typical Duration** | 10-30 minutes per session | Multiple days to weeks |

## Decision Tree Framework

### Primary Question: What is your analytical objective?

**Option A: Immediate Insight and Exploration**
→ Use Agent Workbench

**Option B: Comprehensive Research and Documentation**
→ Use Intelligence Hub

### Secondary Questions for Refinement

**Time Sensitivity Assessment**:
- **Urgent (< 2 hours)**: Workbench for rapid response
- **Moderate (same day)**: Workbench for initial analysis, Hub for formal documentation
- **Extended (multi-day)**: Hub for systematic approach

**Collaboration Requirements**:
- **Individual analysis**: Either platform appropriate
- **Team coordination needed**: Hub for structured collaboration
- **External presentation required**: Hub for formal deliverables

**Analysis Complexity**:
- **Single-dimension questions**: Workbench for direct answers
- **Multi-faceted research**: Hub for systematic decomposition
- **Follow-up intensive**: Workbench for conversational depth
