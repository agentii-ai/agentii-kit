# /twitterkit.implement

Execute Twitter tasks systematically, tracking progress and handling PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycles.

## Prerequisites

- All prior commands complete: constitution, specify, plan, tasks
- `.twitterkit/templates/tasks.md` with breakdown

## Execution Steps

1. **Load tasks.md** and:
   - Extract task list organized by phase
   - Identify dependencies
   - Map to team members and owners

2. **Guide systematic execution** by:
   - Phase-by-phase progress tracking
   - PDCA cycle checkpoints (Plan → Do → Check → Act)
   - Weekly reviews of metrics and learnings
   - Iteration recommendations based on data
   - Unblocking obstacles

3. **Support continuous iteration** by:
   - Tracking what's working and what's not
   - Documenting learnings for next iteration
   - Updating growth loops based on user behavior
   - Adjusting tactics for subsequent phases

## Expected Outputs

- **Executed tasks** from `tasks.md`
- **Metrics tracked** for each phase
- **Weekly updates** with learnings and decisions
- **Iteration log** showing what changed and why

## Validation

- [ ] Tasks executed in correct order
- [ ] Dependencies respected
- [ ] Progress tracked visibly
- [ ] PDCA cycle completed for each phase
- [ ] Metrics measured and analyzed
- [ ] Team aligned on changes

## Notes

- This is a multi-week engagement (4-6 weeks typical)
- Success is measured by campaign outcomes, not activity
- Be prepared to pivot based on data
- Celebrate wins and learn from misses
