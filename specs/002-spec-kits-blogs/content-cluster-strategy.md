## 3. Anchor Text Principles

- Use descriptive anchors that reflect the target topic:
  - "spec-driven development 101".
  - "PMF-Kit tutorial for first-time PMs".
  - "spec-driven MVP case study".
- Avoid generic anchors like "here" or "this post".
- Ensure anchors make sense even when read out of context.

## 4. Future Cluster Expansion Ideas

Examples of follow-up posts that extend this cluster:

1. "Spec-Driven Sprints: Running a 2-Week Cycle with Kits".
2. "From Spec to Agent Network: Orchestrating Multiple Kits".
3. "Common Failure Modes in Spec-Driven Workflows (and How to Fix Them)".
4. "Constitution Engineering for Small Teams".
5. "Turning Legacy Processes into Spec-Driven Kits".

Use this doc when planning new posts and adding internal links during copyedit.
