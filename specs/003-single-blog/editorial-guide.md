# Editorial Guide: 003-Single-Blog

## Blog Type

- Practitioner content:
  - Tutorials and how-to guides.
  - Case studies grounded in real projects or research.
  - Strategy/leadership pieces with concrete playbooks.

## Target Audience

- Primary: Founders, PMs, and engineers who ship products (GitHub, Hacker News, Indie Hackers).
- Secondary: Marketing and content leaders working with AI/agentic workflows.

## Tone

- Conversational, direct, and practical.
- Problem-first: open with the pain or tension the reader feels.
- Confident but not hypey; use evidence instead of buzzwords.
- Avoid corporate/consultant speak.

## Voice Guidelines

- Use **"we"** for the team and **"you"** for the reader.
- Prefer **active voice** over passive.
- Write as a practitioner talking to another practitioner.
- Favor concrete nouns and verbs over abstractions.

### Good Phrases

- "Here’s the problem..."
- "In practice, this looks like..."
- "Here’s the workflow we recommend..."

### Avoid

- Vague statements like "leverage cutting-edge AI" without specifics.
- Overuse of adjectives ("revolutionary", "game-changing") without evidence.

## Structure for Pillar Posts

Most pillar posts (like the 2025 leadership and three-kits articles) follow this pattern:

1. **Problem Statement (Opening)**
   - 1–3 paragraphs.
   - Make the stakes explicit (time, money, risk, opportunity).
2. **Context & Framework**
   - Introduce the core model (e.g., five-phase spec-driven workflow).
   - Explain why it matters now (timeline, market conditions, competitive pressure).
3. **Sections with H2s and H3s**
   - Each H2 covers a major pillar or theme.
   - H3s break down sub-concepts, steps, or examples.
4. **Evidence & Examples**
   - Each major claim should point to at least one Tier 1–3 source.
   - Include 1–3 real-world examples or metrics when possible.
5. **Key Takeaways**
   - 3–5 bullets the reader can remember or quote.
6. **CTA (Call to Action)**
   - Clear, specific next step:
     - Read another post in the cluster.
     - Explore a kit on GitHub.
     - Start a small pilot using the described method.

## Headings & Readability

- Exactly one **H1** per page (handled by frontmatter title).
- Use **H2** for major sections and **H3** for nested points.
- Avoid jumping from H2 directly to H4.
- Aim for Flesch-Kincaid grade **10–13**:
  - Break long sentences (>20 words).
  - Prefer 3–4 sentence paragraphs.

## Evidence & Citations

- Every important quantitative claim (percentages, timelines, productivity gains) must have a supporting source in the references.
- Use the existing reference style from the 12-05 leadership article:
  - Numbered footnotes at bottom.
  - Inline links with descriptive anchor text.

## Examples

- **Good example post**: `content/blog/2025-12-05-organizational-transformation-agentic-era.md`.
  - Strong opening tension.
  - Clear sectioning and evidence.
- **Another example**: `content/blog/2025-12-08-three-kits-one-method.md`.
  - Good cross-functional framing and use of diagrams.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Opening with product features instead of the reader’s problem.
- Long blocks of unbroken text (no headings, no bullets).
- Claims without evidence or links.
- Overly generic CTAs ("Contact us" without context, or no CTA at all).
- Inconsistent terminology (e.g., mixing "spec-driven" with unrelated jargon).
