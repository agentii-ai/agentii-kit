## What Was Generated

### 1. Complete Blog Post with All Elements ✅

**Structure** (all H1/H2/H3 from outline):

**Content Components**:
- ✅ TLDR summary (opening hook, scannable)
- ✅ Introduction: The Problem (blank page issue, rework costs)
- ✅ Core explanation: Four-layer stack (Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks)
- ✅ Comparison: Spec-driven vs. Agile (table format)

- ✅ Real example: 6-week MVP timeline with week-by-week breakdown
- ✅ Getting started guide: Minimal template + sections explained
- ✅ Common mistakes: 5 pitfalls to avoid
- ✅ Future positioning: Why specs are the future
- ✅ FAQ section: 6 common questions with answers
- ✅ Key Takeaways: 5 extractable bullets
- ✅ Limitations section: Honest about edge cases
- ✅ What's Next: Transition to next post in series
- ✅ References section: 6 citations with URLs

### 2. Code Examples (2 included) ✅

**Example 1 - Bad Specification** (vague):
```markdown
Goal: Build a smart scheduling system

What it should do:
- Figure out when meetings should happen
- Make people happy
- Work with calendars
```

**Example 2 - Good Specification** (clear):
```markdown
Problem: Scheduling takes 3 hours/week
Success Criteria: AI schedules 80% automatically
Scope: Internal 1:1 meetings only
Constraints: 2-week deadline, 2-person team
```

### 3. Visual Elements

- ✅ **Diagram**: Four-layer stack (ASCII art + markdown)
- ✅ **Comparison Table**: Spec-driven vs. Agile vs. Waterfall (markdown table)

### 4. SEO & Metadata

**Frontmatter** (YAML):
- title: "Spec-Driven Development 101: A Practitioner's Guide..."
- description: "Learn how spec-driven development reduces rework and ships MVPs faster..."
- date: "2025-12-23"
- author: "agentii-kit contributors"
- tags: ["spec-driven-development", "productivity", "startups", "development-methodology", "ai-agents"]
- keywords: "spec driven development, specification first development, spec coding, ai development"

**Keyword Placement**:
- ✅ Primary keyword "spec driven development" in H1
- ✅ Keyword in first H2: "What is Spec-Driven Development?"
- ✅ Keyword in first 100 words (opening paragraph)
- ✅ Keyword density ~1.2% (not keyword-stuffed)
- ✅ URL slug ready: `spec-driven-development-101`

### 5. Tone & Audience Alignment

✅ **Practitioner style**:
- Conversational, not corporate
- Problem-first (pain point before solution)
- Actionable (minimal template, clear steps)
- Evidence-based (real examples, metrics)

✅ **Target audience** (founders, engineers, CTOs):
- Addresses founder pain ("every project begins with paralysis")
- Real metrics (2x faster, 40% less rework)
- Practical template (2-3 pages, 5 questions)
- AI agent relevance (how specs help AI)

## Next Steps: Phase 3 Preparation

This draft is now ready for **Sprint 1 Phase 3: Technical Review (Non-Author SME)**

### Tasks for Phase 3 (T033-T038):
- [ ] **T033**: Code example testing (run in clean environment)
- [ ] **T034**: SME technical review by non-author
- [ ] **T035**: Evidence tier validation
- [ ] **T036**: Accuracy check on benchmarks/claims
- [ ] **T037**: Feasibility check on recommendations
- [ ] **T038**: Security review

### SME Review Guidance

**Focus areas for SME review**:
1. Are claims about spec-driven approach accurate?
2. Is the four-layer stack explanation clear and correct?
3. Are the "real examples" realistic (6-week MVP, 40% rework reduction)?
4. Are Tier 1-2 sources properly cited?
5. Does the content align with agentii-kit methodology?

**Known placeholders for next phase**:
- Internal links to future posts (Post 2, Post 4, Post 5) - these will be added after those posts publish
- Hero image (`/images/blog/spec-driven-101/hero.jpg`) - needs to be created
- Diagram (currently ASCII art, can be upgraded to Mermaid)
