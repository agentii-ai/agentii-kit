```
Tweet 1: "Just published: 'Don't Code. Specify.'

The problem with modern development: we ship code we didn't really mean to write.

95% of rework comes from vague specs, not bad coding.

Here's how to get 95% accuracy on the first try → [link]"

Tweet 2: "Problem: Founders spend weeks building features that seem clear in conversations but don't match reality.

The feature works.
The vision doesn't.
You rewrite.
You waste months.

The issue isn't the code. It's the source of truth."

Tweet 3: "What if specifications—not code—were the thing humans edited?

What if AI agents generated code *from that specification*?

That's spec-driven development.

And the results are staggering: 95%+ accuracy on first try vs. 40% with vague specs"
