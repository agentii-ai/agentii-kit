# Content Cluster Strategy

This doc supports T015: internal link strategy and content cluster plan.

## 1. Cluster Overview

- **Hub Post (Post 1)**: Spec-Driven Development 101 (foundational concept).
- **Supporting Posts**:
  - Post 2: Getting Started with PMF-Kit (product / PMF tutorial).
  - Post 3: Built MVP in 6 Weeks (case study).
  - Post 4: AI Agent Patterns (technical patterns / architecture).
  - Post 5: Scaling Beyond MVP (growth and org design).

## 2. Internal Link Map (First 5 Posts)

## 3. Anchor Text Principles

- Use **descriptive anchors** that reflect the target keyword and topic.
- Avoid generic anchors like "here" or "this post".
- Make sure anchors make sense even when read out of context.

## 4. Future Content Ideas (Next 10 Posts)

Examples of follow‑up posts that extend the cluster:

1. "Spec‑Driven Development in Regulated Industries" (finance, healthcare).
2. "How to Run a 2‑Week Spec Sprint with a Small Team".
3. "From Spec to Agent: Turning Requirements into Tools".
4. "Common Failure Modes in Agentic Workflows (and How Specs Prevent Them)".
5. "Designing Constitutions for Product, Content, and Marketing Teams".
6. "Running Cross‑Functional Launches from a Single Spec".
7. "Spec‑Driven Documentation for Engineering Teams".
8. "Using Analytics to Refine Your Specs Over Time".
9. "Teaching New Hires Spec‑Driven Workflows in 2 Weeks".
10. "Spec‑Driven Patterns for AI‑Heavy MVPs".

Use this doc when planning new posts and when adding internal links during copyedit.
