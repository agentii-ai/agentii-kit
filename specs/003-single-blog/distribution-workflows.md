# Distribution Workflow Templates

Use these templates for T013 to distribute each new post consistently.

## 1. Twitter Thread Template (1 main + 5–7 follow-ups)

**Tweet 1 – Hook + Problem**

> The window to adapt to the agentic era is closing. Most orgs still treat AI as a bolt‑on tool instead of redesigning workflows for agents. Here’s how to fix that ↓

Include:
- Core tension or stat.
- Link to post at the end of the thread, not in the first tweet (optional for experimentation).

**Tweets 2–3 – Problem & Stakes**

- Summarize 2–3 key problems from the post (e.g., unstructured workflows, rework, inconsistent quality).
- Keep each tweet 200–260 chars.

**Tweets 4–5 – Framework / Method**

- Explain the core model (e.g., five-phase spec‑driven workflow).
- 1 tweet per phase or 1 tweet summarizing the full loop.

**Tweets 6–7 – Proof & CTA**

- Share 1–2 data points or case snippets.
- Final tweet:

> We broke down the full spec‑driven workflow (with examples) here: [link]
> 
> If you’re leading product, content, or marketing, this is the playbook we wish we had 2 years ago.

## 2. LinkedIn Post Template

**Structure (150–300 chars + bullets):**

1. Opening line: problem + audience.
2. 3–5 bullets with insights from the post.
3. CTA with link.

**Example Skeleton:**

> Most teams still treat AI as a bolt‑on tool. In practice, the winners are redesigning their orgs for human–agent workflows.
>
> 3 shifts we’re seeing:
> - From org charts → work charts.
> - From email chains → agent networks.
> - From task execution → agent orchestration.
>

## 3. Dev.to Cross-Post Template

- **Title**: Same or slightly adapted for Dev.to audience.
- **Frontmatter / Settings**:
  - Set **canonical URL** to the original kits.agentii.ai post.
- **Intro Note** at top of post:

> _This article was originally published on our blog at [kits.agentii.ai](https://kits.agentii.ai)._ 

- **Body**: Same content as on your blog.
- **Tags**: 3–5 Dev.to tags relevant to the topic.

## 4. Newsletter Email Template (Substack)

**Subject line examples:**

- "Spec‑Driven Development 101 for Founders"
- "The Leadership Imperative for the Agentic Era"

**Preview text:**

- 60–90 chars expanding the subject with the key benefit.

**Body structure:**

1. Short intro paragraph linking the post to current concerns.
2. 3 bullets with key insights.
3. Main CTA button / link to the post.
4. 2–3 related links (other posts or external articles).
