## Timeline & Sprints

- **Sprint 0 (Weeks 0–1)**: Platform + editorial setup (current work).
- **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1–3)**: Post 1 (Spec-Driven 101) – research → draft → publish.
- **Sprint 2 (Weeks 4–5)**: Post 2 (PMF-Kit tutorial).
- **Sprint 3 (Weeks 6–7)**: Post 3 (MVP case study).
- **Sprint 4 (Weeks 8–10)**: Post 4 (AI agent patterns).
- **Sprint 5 (Weeks 11–15)**: Post 5 (Scaling beyond MVP).

### Dependencies

- Sprint 0 → Sprint 1 (must complete platform + guides + templates first).
- Sprints 2–5 can run research in parallel once Sprint 1 is in draft/copyedit.

## Publishing Cadence

- Aim for **1 post per 2–3 weeks** during the foundation phase.
- Prefer **Tue–Thu, 7–9 AM EST** for initial publish.

## Distribution Checklist per Post

For each published post:

- [ ] Newsletter feature (Substack): subject, preview text, summary, main CTA.
- [ ] Twitter thread (1 main + 5–7 follow‑ups).
- [ ] LinkedIn post (150–300 chars + image + 3–5 bullets).
- [ ] Dev.to cross‑post with canonical back to kits.agentii.ai.
- [ ] Optional: Hacker News / Indie Hackers submission (if technical enough).

Use this calendar together with `distribution-workflows.md` and `content-cluster-strategy.md` to keep posts and distribution in sync.
