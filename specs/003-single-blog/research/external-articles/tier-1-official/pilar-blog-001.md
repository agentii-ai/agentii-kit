target readers, the same target audience as the agentii-kit 

- **Purpose**: Growth-hacking amplifier via open-source spec-driven kits and technical deep-dives
- **Target Audience**: Geeks, startup founders, VCs, product designers, anyone building agentic systems
- **Content Themes**: Spec-driven development, agent orchestration patterns, kit documentation, startup growth playbooks
- **Success Metric**: Organic reach into Silicon Valley, VC/founder mindshare, GitHub stars, framework adoption
- **Strategic Role**: Support agentii.ai launch by creating organic reach and developer credibility (users who learn agentii-kit may become agentii.ai customers)


# title

Don't Code. Specify.

# subtitle

How spec-driven development gets 95% accuracy on the first try


## title requirements

we need a strong, eye catching title, great wordings, simplicity is always better than long redudent words, you can have a longer subtitle.

good examples are political slogans like "if you don't vote, you don't matters", i want the title always short and strong, the subtitle can be longer and more detailed.


## interesting points and ideas to share

- **Specs as the “real source code”**  
  - **Code becomes a compiled artifact**; the *spec* is the thing humans edit.  
  - Long-term vision: humans rarely touch code directly—only specs.

- **95%+ first-pass accuracy is possible**  
  - With strong specs, AI can hit >95% correctness on first implementation, vs “vibe coding” that needs tons of patching.  
  - The surprising bit: *quality comes more from spec clarity than from model choice*.

- **Spec-first → Spec-anchored → Spec-as-source spectrum**  
  - Not binary. Teams can gradually move from “we wrote a spec once” to “we only touch specs now”.

- **Three-layer spec stack is the new API design**  
  - **Functional “what”**, **language-agnostic “how”**, **language-specific “how”**.  
  - This mirrors good architecture, but framed explicitly for AI agents.



- **Simplicity beats frameworks (Anthropic, Hugging Face)**  
  - Most successful production agents use **simple, composable patterns**, not heavyweight frameworks.  
  - Extra abstraction layers make debugging and upgrades *worse*, not better.

- **Instructions > everything (OpenAI)**  
  - For agents, **high-quality instructions and existing SOPs** matter more than clever prompts or framework choice.


- **Source of truth is moving upstream (a16z)**  
  - In the AI era, the important artifacts are: prompts, data schemas, API contracts, architecture intent.  
  - Git becomes a log of *decisions and specs*, not just code diffs.

- **The “one-person unicorn” vision (Sequoia)**  
  - Agent networks + infrastructure → a single founder can run a billion‑dollar‑scale operation with autonomous agents doing most work.

## My Top 3 Picks for agentii-kit audience:

1. **"Don't Code. Specify."** — direct, contrarian, memorable
2. **"Vibe Coding is Over."** — punchy, timely, provocative
3. **"One Founder. One Billion."** — aspirational, VC-bait, visionary

Pick one, or mix-and-match a title + different subtitle?
