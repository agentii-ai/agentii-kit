# Step 2: Define critical information for your project (Twitter-first)

This step corresponds to the **spec.md / `/twitterkit.specify`** phase in Spec Kit, but is tuned for **Twitter (X) initiation, writing, and growth** for an **AI/LLM SaaS or agent product**.

At this stage, you should define:

- Who the product is for (personas and segments) *as they show up on Twitter*  
- What core problems and jobs-to-be-done it solves (and how those map to threads, demos, and daily content)  
- What the initial product scope and “hero workflows” are (and which ones become your **irrefutable demos**)  
- How you will recognize product-market fit and Twitter traction (behavioral and business signals)  
- What constraints, risks, and open questions shape both the product and your Twitter strategy

Keep this **non-technical**: no models, infra, or architecture details here. This is the narrative and workflow layer that powers your Twitter growth, not the implementation.

---

## 1. Project summary

- **Working name:** (to be filled by founder / team)  
- **Product type:** AI/LLM-powered SaaS / agent product  
- **Domain:** (e.g., developer tools, creative tools, vertical/enterprise, productivity)  
- **Primary goal:** Achieve strong, repeatable **product-market fit and Twitter traction** for a narrowly defined use case in the chosen domain.  
- **Twitter narrative type:**  
  - Are you closer to an **incremental upgrade** (Cursor-style: “AI-native version of a workflow people already love”) or a **revolutionary leap** (Devin-style: “new category / AI does the job for you”)?  
  - One line that captures this narrative for Twitter: *"[Product] is the [incremental/revolutionary] way for [persona] to [core job]."*  
- **One-line value prop for pinned tweet / bio:**  
  - In ≤160 characters, describe the painful problem, your magic, and the outcome. This will become:  
    - Your Twitter bio line  
    - The opening line of your pinned thread  
    - The default “explain it in one sentence” answer

## 2. Target users & personas (Twitter-facing)

Describe 1–2 *primary* personas you care about for the first Twitter push. Be specific about how they behave **on Twitter and in their daily work**.

- **Primary persona (core user):**  
  - Role and seniority (e.g., senior backend engineer, video creator, in-house counsel, product marketer)  
  - Company size and context (indie, startup, SMB, mid-market, enterprise team)  
  - Daily tools and environment (IDE, design tools, office suite, communication tools, project management tools)  
  - How they currently use Twitter:  
    - What accounts they follow (types, not names)  
    - What they post (if at all)  
    - What problems, rants, and questions they surface publicly  
  - What would make them *stop scrolling* and pay attention (numbers, demos, contrarian takes, founder journey, etc.)

- **Secondary persona (optional):**  
  - If there is a clear secondary user (e.g., reviewer/manager, collaborator), describe who they are and how they interact with the product.  
  - How they might discover you on Twitter (through ICs they manage, investors, community leads, etc.).

- **Influencer / amplifier persona (optional):**  
  - Micro-creators or “power users” who are not your primary user but can massively amplify your launch (e.g., dev-tool influencers, design Twitter, AI agents nerds).  
  - What kind of content would make them want to quote-tweet or thread about you (data teardowns, “Wall Street secret” style posts, spicy takes, founder vulnerability, etc.).

## 3. Core problems and jobs-to-be-done

Focus on problems that are **painful enough to drive organic Twitter conversation** and **clear enough to turn into threads, demos, and daily content**.

- **Top problems today (for the primary persona):**  
  - What work is slow, tedious, expensive, or error-prone?  
  - Where do they rely on multiple tools or manual glue work?  
  - What do they avoid doing because it’s too painful?  
  - Which of these problems already show up as complaints, rants, or questions on Twitter today? (Link to real example tweets if you have them.)

- **Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD):**  
  For each problem, write 1–3 JTBD statements of the form:  
  - "When [situation], I want to [job], so I can [outcome]."  
  Then, for each JTBD, add:  
  - "On Twitter, I could show this as: [1–2 ideas for a thread, demo clip, or before/after story]."

- **Existing alternatives:**  
  - What tools and workflows do they use today (including non-AI tools, agencies, spreadsheets, scripts, or nothing)?  
  - How do users talk about these alternatives on Twitter (praise, frustrations, memes, feature requests)?  
  - Where is there a clear gap between what existing tools promise vs. what the persona actually experiences day-to-day?

## 4. Initial product scope and hero workflows (and Twitter demos)

Define the **first wedge** and **hero workflows** that the product will support. These should be **narrow and high-value**, similar in spirit to how:

- Cursor / Claude Code / Devin focus on specific coding loops  
- Runway / Pika / HeyGen focus on specific video creation/editing flows  
- Harvey / Writer focus on specific legal or enterprise content tasks  
- Canva / Figma / Notion focus on specific creation and collaboration patterns

Then map those workflows directly into content and demo strategy.

- **Single wedge use case:**  
  - One clearly defined use case where the product aims to become the *default* tool for the primary persona.  
  - Twitter version (10–20 words) that a user would quote-tweet:  
    - "[Product] is the easiest way for [persona] to [job] without [annoying thing]."

- **Hero workflow (end-to-end):**  
  - 5–8 concrete steps from user intent → AI-assisted work → finished artifact or outcome.  
  - What inputs the user provides (docs, data, briefs, repositories, videos, etc.).  
  - What kind of outputs they expect (PRs, documents, videos, designs, reports, decisions).  
  - For each step, describe:  
    - What would the **15–60s “irrefutable demo” clip** look like?  
    - What metrics or before/after contrast can be shown in a tweet screenshot (speed, quality, volume, revenue, risk reduction)?

- **Content-ready workflows:**  
  - Identify 2–3 workflows that naturally produce shareable artifacts (clips, screenshots, charts, side-by-side comparisons).  
  - Describe how users could share their outputs on Twitter (UGC loop) and what hashtag or framing you would encourage (e.g., #BuiltWith[Product], "We asked [Product] to…").

- **Out-of-scope (for now):**  
  - Adjacent use cases and personas you are *deliberately not* targeting in the first Twitter phase.  
  - How you will politely say “not yet” when asked about these on Twitter (a one-line answer you can reuse).

## 5. Desired user outcomes and value

Describe what “10x better” looks like for the primary persona, in a way that can be **proven in screenshots, threads, and user stories**.

- **Functional outcome:**  
  - What can they now do that they could not do before?  
  - Which workflows become realistically possible for smaller teams or individuals?  
  - How would a user describe this in a tweet like: *"Before [Product] → [state]. After [Product] → [state + metric]."*

- **Efficiency outcome:**  
  - Time savings on key tasks or projects.  
  - Reduction in external spend (agencies, contractors, tools) if applicable.  
  - Concrete “Wall Street secret” or “I analyzed X, here’s what I found” style claims you can back with data (e.g., "Cuts [task] time from 3 hours to 10 minutes"), suitable for hooks.

- **Quality outcome:**  
  - Fewer errors/bugs/mistakes.  
  - More consistent outputs, better adherence to brand/standards/policies.  
  - How you will **show your work** (citations, reasoning traces, side-by-side comparisons) so you avoid over-promising and can be radically transparent.

- **Emotional outcome:**  
  - How does the product change how users *feel* about this part of their job (e.g., from anxiety to confidence, from boring to creative)?  
  - What 1–2 emotional stories or quotes you’d love to see in the wild (e.g., "I’d be very disappointed if this disappeared," "This finally makes [job] feel doable as a solo founder").

## 6. Twitter signals and success metrics (non-technical)

Define how you will recognize early Twitter signals for this AI SaaS product. Focus on **user behavior and business outcomes**, not models or infra.

- **Engagement & retention (product + Twitter):**  
  - Expected product usage frequency (daily, weekly, per project).  
  - Target retention curves or minimum acceptable retention (e.g., % of users still active after 1/4/12 weeks).  
  - Twitter cadence: how many posts/threads per week from:  
    - Founder account  
    - Product account  
  - Target engagement rate from **ideal customer profiles**, not just general followers.

- **Depth of usage:**  
  - How often users complete the hero workflow.  
  - Whether users keep the product open during their core work sessions.  
  - % of users who generate at least one **shareable artifact** per week (demo clip, screenshot, case study) that could appear on Twitter.

- **Value and willingness to pay:**  
  - Signals that users or teams are willing to pay or expand usage (e.g., upgrades, adding teammates, moving real projects into the product).  
  - Twitter-specific demand signals: DMs asking for access, replies asking for pricing, waitlist signups attributed from Twitter, reply/quote-tweet threads asking deeper product questions.

- **Qualitative Twitter signals:**  
  - “Very disappointed if this product went away” responses.  
  - Quotes that show the product has become the default way they do the job.  
  - How often users organically mention you in relevant conversations (share of voice on key narratives).  
  - Screenshots or threads where users explain your workflow better than you do.

## 7. Constraints, risks, and assumptions

List the non-technical factors that shape how you approach product and Twitter.

- **Market & segment constraints:**  
  - Budget levels, procurement friction, competition, regulatory environment.  
  - Any compliance or risk constraints on what you can publicly claim about outcomes (especially in finance, health, or legal).

- **Adoption constraints:**  
  - Need for trust, governance, approvals, or legal/compliance sign-off.  
  - Change management in teams already using tools like Canva, Figma, Notion, existing IDEs, or legacy processes.  
  - How this will shape your Twitter tone (e.g., more conservative, more transparent about limitations, more focused on workflows than “magic”).

- **Assumptions to validate:**  
  - Assumptions about user behavior, appetite for AI automation/agents, and switching costs.  
  - Assumptions about how quickly you can iterate with real users.  
  - Assumptions about Twitter as your main distribution channel (how much of your early growth you expect to come from Twitter vs. other channels).

- **Key risks:**  
  - Being a thin wrapper around foundation models (no workflow or data moat).  
  - Over-broad scope and weak traction for any one use case.  
  - “Autonomy theater” that overpromises what the AI/agent can do.  
  - Over-automating Twitter (spammy agents, generic replies, aggressive follow/unfollow) and damaging trust with your core audience.  
  - Product and Twitter narratives drifting apart (what you say vs. what users actually experience).

## 8. Open questions

Capture the biggest unknowns you want to investigate next. These should drive **user interviews, Twitter experiments, and content tests**.

- Which exact persona and segment shows the strongest early pull?  
- Which hero workflow is the best starting wedge (and gets the strongest engagement when demoed on Twitter)?  
- What pricing and packaging will align with perceived value and budget?  
- Which channels (community, ecosystem, integrations) are likely to drive early distribution—and how does Twitter plug into those?  
- Which narratives and hooks resonate most strongly (contrarian takes, “Wall Street secret” style, founder journey, raw demos, customer stories)?  
- What would make influencers or community leaders *want* to talk about you without being paid?

These questions will drive research, user interviews, and structured Twitter experiments (threads, demos, Spaces, DMs) in later steps.

# Refining the Twitter-First Spec: Best Practices from 2024–2025 AI Winners

Based on an extensive analysis of successful AI SaaS strategies from **Cursor, Devin, Runway, Harvey, and HeyGen**, here are concrete refinements and critical questions to add to your spec. These additions will help you move from a generic launch plan to a high-signal Twitter operation.

***

## 1. Project Summary: Refining the Narrative

*Add a specific "Narrative Anchor" field to force a choice between the two dominant 2024–2025 patterns.*

### **Add to Spec:**
- **Narrative Anchor:**
  - **The "Super-Suit" (Incremental):** "You, but 10x faster." (e.g., **Cursor**, **Supermaven**, **Writer**). Best for tools that fit *inside* existing workflows (IDE, Docs).
    - *Twitter Hook:* "Stop writing boilerplate. Let [Product] handle the boring parts."
  - **The "Digital Employee" (Revolutionary):** "Hire an agent to do this job." (e.g., **Devin**, **Harvey**, **Manus**). Best for tools that take over a complete loop (PR review, Legal research, Video localization).
    - *Twitter Hook:* "I just hired my first AI engineer/lawyer/editor. Watch it work while I sleep."

## 2. Target Users & Personas: Behavioral Segmentation

*Move beyond job titles. In 2025, segmentation is about "Twitter Behavior" and "Risk Appetite."*

### **Add to Spec:**
- **The "Lighthouse User" (Primary Persona):**
  - Instead of just "Senior Engineer," specify: *"The 'Reply-Guy' Engineer who prides themselves on speed."*
  - **Signal:** They post screenshots of their terminal/editor. They use terms like "shipping," "velocity," and "stack."
  - **Why them?** They are your distribution engine. If you make them look fast/smart, they *will* promote you.
- **The "Skeptic-Convert" (Secondary Persona):**
  - The influential senior figure who claims "AI writes bad code/copy."
  - **Strategy:** Win them over not with hype, but with *correctness* and *control*.
  - **Twitter Content:** "Here is [Product] catching a bug that a human reviewer missed."

## 3. Core Problems & JTBD: The "Pain vs. Magic" Spectrum

*Successful Twitter content oscillates between "solving agony" and "showing magic." Map your problems to these two buckets.*

### **Add to Spec:**
- **The "Agony" Problem (For Threads/Rants):**
  - Identify a specific task that makes your user want to quit. (e.g., *"Migrating a legacy codebase," "Resizing 50 videos for TikTok," "Checking citations in a legal brief"*).
  - *Twitter Format:* "The old way vs. The new way" side-by-side comparison.
- **The "Magic" Outcome (For Viral Demos):**
  - A capability that feels illegal or impossible.
  - *Example:* **Runway Gen-3** showing a static image morphing into a film. **Devin** resolving a GitHub issue autonomously.
  - *Metric:* "Time-to-Wow" < 15 seconds in a video clip.

## 4. Initial Product Scope & Hero Workflows: The "Irrefutable Demo"

*This is the most critical section. Your product scope must be defined by what can be demoed convincingly in a 30-second video.*

### **Add to Spec:**
- **The "Irrefutable Demo" Checklist:**
  - Does the clip start *in media res* (no login screens, no setup)?
  - Is the speed real or accelerated? (Be transparent: "x2 speed" in corner).
  - Is the output "production-ready" or just a toy? (Twitter audiences in 2025 ruthlessly mock "hello world" demos).
- **The "Artifact" Strategy:**
  - What asset does the user get at the end that is *inherently shareable*?
    - **Good:** A deployed web app (Lovable), a video (HeyGen), a Pull Request summary (Claude Code).
    - **Bad:** A text summary, a chat log, a dashboard.

## 5. Desired Outcomes: Quantifiable & Emotional

*Move from abstract "efficiency" to concrete "Wall Street Secret" style claims.*

### **Add to Spec:**
- **The "Unfair Advantage" Metric:**
  - "Cuts [Task] from [X hours] to [Y minutes]."
  - *Harvey Example:* "Reviewed 50 contracts in the time it takes to drink a coffee."
- **The "Flow State" Promise:**
  - How does it change the *feeling* of work?
  - *Cursor Example:* "Coding at the speed of thought." (Focus on maintaining flow, not just raw speed).

## 6. Twitter Signals & Success Metrics: The "High-Quality" Filter

*Forget follower counts. In 2025, metrics are about "Signal Quality."*

### **Add to Spec:**
- **The "Quote-Tweet Ratio":**
  - High QTs with "Wait, is this real?" or "I need this" > High Likes.
- **The "DM Inbound" Rate:**
  - Are high-value prospects (investors, enterprise buyers) sliding into DMs to ask for access?
- **"Built With" Volume:**
  - Count of organic posts using your hashtag or mentioning your handle alongside a screenshot of their work.
- **Waitlist Quality Score:**
  - Use a tool (or manual review) to score signups based on their Twitter bio/following. 100 signups from target personas > 10,000 randoms.

## 7. Constraints, Risks, & Assumptions: The "Autonomy Trap"

*Acknowledge the specific risks of AI products in the current hype cycle.*

### **Add to Spec:**
- **The "Autonomy Theater" Risk:**
  - If you promise "autonomous agents" (Devin-style), you risk a massive backlash if the agent gets stuck.
  - *Constraint:* How do we handle failure gracefully? (e.g., "Human-in-the-loop handoff" or "Copilot mode").
- **The "Generic Wrapper" Accusation:**
  - Twitter users will call you a "ChatGPT wrapper."
  - *Defense:* Define exactly what proprietary data or workflow UX makes you defensible.

## 8. Open Questions: Testing Your Hypotheses

*Use these questions to drive your "Spec Kit" research phase.*

### **Add to Spec:**
- **Pricing Perception:** "Will users pay $20/mo (Prosumer) or $2,000/mo (Enterprise) for this?" (Test this via DM conversations).
- **Distribution Loops:** "Does the product naturally encourage sharing?" (e.g., Watermarks, 'Sent by [Agent]', Public share links).
- **The "Vibe" Check:** "Is our tone 'Helpful Assistant' (humble) or 'Superintelligence' (bold)?" (Test two different thread styles).

***

### **Refined "Step 2" Template Guidance**

When filling out your **Target Users** section, explicitly ask:
> *"Who is the 'Power User' that will defend us in the comments when skeptics attack?"*

When filling out your **Hero Workflow**, explicitly ask:
> *"If I screen-recorded this workflow raw, would it go viral? If not, the product scope is wrong for a Twitter-first launch."*
