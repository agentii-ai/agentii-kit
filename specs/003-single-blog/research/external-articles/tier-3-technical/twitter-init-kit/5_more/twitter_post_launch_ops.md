# Post-Launch Twitter Operations: Running Your AI Agent Product Account (100-1,000+ Users)

## Executive Summary

After your product launch and initial follower acquisition, Twitter operations shift from rapid growth tactics to sustainable, compound growth—where consistency, engagement velocity, and community retention drive exponential expansion. Based on successful playbooks from Lovable (176K followers, $100M ARR in 8 months), Cursor (1M+ DAU), Rogo AI, Hebbia, and Harvey AI, this guide focuses on practical day-to-day operations that maintain growth momentum from 100 to 1,000+ followers while converting engaged followers into paying customers.

The critical insight from top-performing products: **Post-launch success isn't about going viral again—it's about maintaining a predictable, compounding engagement machine that creates 2-3x growth every 60 days.**

## Phase 1: Establishing Your Daily Operations Framework (Weeks 1-2 Post-Launch)

### 1.1 Building Your Twitter Operations Team Structure

**Minimum Viable Team (for 100-1K followers phase)**:

1. **Content Lead** (Founder or 1 person, 4-6 hours/week)
   - Creates daily content threads
   - Curates market insights
   - Maintains editorial calendar
   - Responds to comments/DMs within 60 minutes

2. **Community Manager** (0.5-1 person, 3-5 hours/week)
   - Engages with target accounts (50+ comments/day)
   - Responds to DMs and mentions
   - Runs Twitter Spaces or Q&A sessions
   - Tracks sentiment and community feedback

3. **Analytics/Growth Owner** (Founder or 1 person, 2-3 hours/week)
   - Analyzes daily metrics
   - Tests content variations
   - Optimizes posting times
   - Manages scheduling automation

**Why This Structure**: Lovable succeeded because they separated content creation (Anton, founder) from community management (Henrik, growth). This dual-track approach allowed parallel scaling—one person built thought leadership while another scaled community. You don't need more people initially; you need clarity on responsibilities.

**Scaling Timeline**:
- 100-300 followers: 1 founder handles all (part-time)
- 300-700 followers: Add 0.5 community manager (freelancer via Upwork)
- 700-1,500 followers: Founder + full community manager + part-time analytics

### 1.2 Establish Your Content Operations Workflow

**Weekly Workflow (Batching System)**:

**Sunday, 2 hours** - Content Planning Sprint
- Review past week's engagement metrics (which content got >2% engagement)
- Plan next week's 20-25 tweets around 3-5 content pillars
- Create content library in Notion/Trello with themes, hooks, CTAs
- Identify 3-5 trending topics/upcoming announcements relevant to your niche

**Tuesday-Wednesday, 1.5 hours each** - Content Creation
- Write 10-12 tweets at a time using your approved hooks
- Create visuals/screenshots showing product in action
- Schedule all tweets in Buffer/Postiz for Week 2
- Create 1-2 long-form threads (5-8 tweets)

**Friday, 1 hour** - Community Management Review
- Review analytics from the week (impressions, engagement rate, follower growth)
- Identify 5 top performers (tweets with >100 engagements)
- Analyze what made them work (hook style, topic, format)
- Extract learnings for next week's content

**Daily, 15 minutes (morning)** - Real-Time Engagement
- Respond to all comments on your tweets (within 60 minutes of posting)
- Reply to 5-10 mentions from target accounts
- Read 3-5 top tweets from your industry
- Retweet 1-2 valuable insights from thought leaders

**Daily, 10 minutes (evening)** - Community Monitoring

- Flag any customer issues/feedback for product team
- Note trending topics for tomorrow's engagement

**Tool Stack for This Workflow**:
- Buffer or Postiz (content scheduling, batching)
- Notion (content calendar, performance tracking)
- TweetDeck or Tweetify (real-time monitoring)
- Google Sheets (weekly metrics dashboard)
- Loom (quick demo videos for tweets)

**Cost**: ~$80-150/month (Buffer Pro $15, Notion free, TweetDeck free, Loom free tier)

### 1.3 Create Your Content Pillars (Financial AI Stock Analysis Focus)

For a financial AI product, organize content into 5 rotating pillars (these keep your account focused and predictable):

**Pillar 1: Market Insights (20% of posts)**
- Daily/weekly market themes your product uncovers
- "Our AI flagged this pattern in [sector]. Here's why it matters..."
- Commentary on earnings season, Fed decisions, sector rotations
- Always tie back to: "This is why manual analysis misses opportunities"

**Example Thread**:
"Just analyzed 500+ earnings calls. Here's what hedge funds will miss this quarter. Thread on hidden value signals 🧵

1/ Most analysts focus on guidance beats. But our AI spotted something 94% of traders don't notice: when companies upgrade forward guidance in ONE category while downgrading in others.

2/ This pattern predicted 40%+ underperformance within 6 months. Why? It signals management confidence in one area but serious risk in another.

3/ [Company example] did exactly this last quarter. Upgraded software revenue, downgraded hardware. Our AI flagged it. Stock down 15% in 3 months."

**Pillar 2: Behind-the-Scenes Product/Data (15% of posts)**
- Model updates and accuracy improvements
- Data insights from your beta users
- Feature rollouts and roadmap hints
- "We retrained on 50M new data points. Here's what changed..."

**Example Posts**:
- "Added biotech sector analysis to our model. Accuracy jumped from 71% → 89%. Biotech companies have 3 unique accounting patterns most tools miss."
- "Our AI processed 2.3M 10-K filings this week. Pattern spotted: companies with declining R&D spend outperformed by 25% in months 4-6 after the cut."
- "Just shipped: real-time portfolio risk alerts. Users can now ask 'what's the drawdown risk if tech drops 10%?' and get answers instantly."

**Pillar 3: Educational/Framework Content (25% of posts)**
- "Most retail investors don't know..." threads
- Stock analysis frameworks explained
- How professional investors use specific metrics
- Why AI excels at pattern recognition in finance

**Example Threads**:
"The biggest mistake retail investors make: ignoring free cash flow trends.

1/ Everyone watches P/E ratios. But here's the truth: 67% of earnings "beats" don't matter if FCF is declining.

2/ Why? P/E can be artificially low due to one-time charges. But FCF doesn't lie—it's cash moving to the bank.

3/ [Our AI spots this in seconds]. Manual research takes 20 hours per stock."

**Pillar 4: User Success Stories/Testimonials (15% of posts)**
- Case studies of beta users finding opportunities
- Specific ROI or time saved
- Direct quotes from users
- "Here's how one of our users spotted a $200K opportunity..."

**Example Posts**:
- "One user found this opportunity in 2 minutes using our AI. He bought at $45. Analysts had a $78 target. Now at $71. That's 58% in 8 weeks."
- "Portfolio manager says our AI saved 6 hours per day on research. She can now analyze 200 stocks instead of 20. That's 10x analyst bandwidth."
- "This hedge fund trader told us: 'Your AI caught something my team missed in 3 weeks of DD.' He doubled down and made $2.3M. (His words, not ours.)"

**Pillar 5: Engagement/Community Building (25% of posts)**
- Polls and questions to your audience
- Contrarian takes on investing
- "What's stopping you from..." challenge posts
- Retweets of great market commentary + your insight

**Example Posts**:
- Poll: "Most investors focus on P/E. What's YOUR #1 stock metric? Vote below"
- "Take: The best stock picks come from people who understand the business, not people who understand the algorithm. Your thoughts?"
- "Quick question: If you could automate ONE part of your stock research, what would it be? (Asking because we're building it.)"

**Posting Frequency**:
- Days 1-30 post-launch: 3-5 tweets/day
- Days 31-90: 4-6 tweets/day (mix of scheduled + real-time)
- Day 90+: 3-4 tweets/day (focus on quality over volume, compounding existing threads)

## Phase 2: Daily Operations - The 60-Minute Morning/Evening Ritual

### 2.1 The Morning Engagement Ritual (15 minutes, 7-8 AM)

**5-Minute Check**: Real-time monitoring
- Open TweetDeck, check your account column for overnight mentions/replies
- Scan your replies on last night's tweets
- Check if any tweet is trending (>500 engagement overnight = likely to continue climbing)
- Note which timezone your engagement came from (West Coast followers? Asia traders?)

**5-Minute Responses**:
- Reply to top 3 comments on your tweets (prioritize high-follower accounts)
- Template for responses that drive more engagement:
  - Acknowledge the comment specifically (not generic)
  - Add NEW information they might not know
  - Ask a follow-up question to keep conversation going
  - Example: "Great point on [specific thing they said]. Most people miss that [your insight]. What patterns are you seeing in [related topic]?"

**5-Minute Engagement Mode**:
- Find 5 high-follower accounts (50K+) in your niche
- Read their latest tweet
- Leave a thoughtful comment (not "great post!" but substantive value-add)
- This gets your name seen by their 50K followers, drives profile visits
- Goal: 2-3 profile visits lead to 1 new follower

### 2.2 Content Publishing Ritual (5 minutes, 9 AM)

Your scheduled tweet posts. During first 30 minutes:
- Like your own tweet (signals activity to algorithm)
- Leave a reply to your own tweet adding context or data
- Check if it's getting initial engagement (>50 likes in first 10 min = likely to go further)
- If NOT getting traction, reply with a reframe: "Most people ask [wrong question]. But here's what actually matters..."

### 2.3 Mid-Day Market Reaction (Optional, 10 minutes, 12 PM)

**If you're a stock analysis AI product**, there's opportunity here:
- Major market moves happen at open (if US) or at close
- Quickly analyze what your product reveals about what's moving
- Post: "S&P 500 down 2%. Here's what our AI sees in the rubble..."

This real-time relevance gets massive engagement because you're commenting on LIVE market events with your product's unique insight.

### 2.4 Evening Wind-Down (10 minutes, 5-6 PM)

- Reply to any new comments/DMs
- Retweet 2-3 valuable pieces of content from thought leaders + add your insight
- If a tweet from morning is performing well (>200 engagement), plan to retweet it again tomorrow (different audience in different timezones)
- Check Google Analytics: did Twitter send any traffic to your landing page today?

### 2.5 The Weekly Friday Review (45 minutes)

This is where you extract lessons to multiply next week's impact:

**Metrics to Track**:
| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Follower growth | 15-30/week | Indicates if your account is gaining traction |
| Engagement rate | 1.5-3% | Shows if content resonates (industry avg is 0.029%) |
| Total impressions | 50K-150K/week | Raw reach (early stage accounts) |
| Link clicks | 200-500/week | Actual traffic to your product |
| Reply/mention rate | 20-50/week | Community is engaging back |
| Profile visits | 500-1,500/week | People curious enough to check you out |

**Analysis Process**:
1. Open Buffer analytics
2. Find your top 3 performing tweets (by engagement)
3. Document what made them work:
   - Hook (how did it start?)
   - Topic (which pillar?)
   - Format (thread vs single tweet vs poll?)
   - Timing (when posted?)
4. Find your 3 worst performers
5. Document what didn't work
6. Create a "win pattern" doc: "Threads about [topic] with [hook] format posted at [time] get 3-5x engagement"
7. Plan next week to repeat winners

**Example Analytics Sheet**:
```
Date | Tweet | Topic | Engagement | Engagement % | Format | Posted At | Insight
11/1 | "Most investors miss..." | Education | 520 | 2.8% | Thread | 9 AM EST | Contrarian hooks work
11/2 | "New feature added" | Product | 85 | 0.4% | Single | 2 PM EST | Timing off, topic weak
11/3 | "[User] found $200K" | Social Proof | 310 | 1.6% | Thread | 9 AM EST | Case studies convert well
```

## Phase 3: Viral Content Strategy (Compound Growth Mechanics)

### 3.1 The Retweet Amplification Loop

After your tweet gets initial traction (100+ likes), don't leave it alone. Amplify it:

**Hour 1-2**: Your tweet posts, gets 50-100 likes
- Respond to comments (each reply increases reach)
- Like all positive comments
- Retweet people's replies about your tweet

**Hour 24**: If tweet has 200+ engagements
- Retweet your own tweet with new context: "This got 200+ retweets overnight. Here's why it matters..."
- This catches the next timezone wave (different audience sees it)

**Day 3-4**: If tweet has 500+ engagements
- Create a follow-up thread expanding on the original: "Part 2 of the thread that got 500+ of you asking questions..."
- This creates a series effect—people binge your content

**Why this works**: Each amplification extends the tweet's lifespan. Your original reach might be 50K people. A well-timed retweet 24 hours later reaches a DIFFERENT 50K. By Day 3, you've potentially reached 150K different people from 1 piece of content.

### 3.2 Content Series Strategy (Compound Growth)

Instead of random tweets, create **series** that people follow sequentially:

**Example: "Stock Analysis Series"** (Posted every Monday)
- "Part 1: The #1 metric everyone ignores"
- "Part 2: How to spot it in 10-K filings"
- "Part 3: How our AI automates this (saves 20 hours)"
- "Part 4: Here's what we found analyzing 500 companies"

**Why this works**: People start binging your account. They follow from Part 1 → want to read Part 2 → subscribe to your newsletter/product.

**Series Ideas for Financial AI**:
1. "Financial Analysis Framework" (5-part series, posted weekly)
2. "Most Common Investment Mistakes" (10-part series, one per week)
3. "Case Study Fridays" (every Friday, new user success story)
4. "Chart of the Week" (every Thursday, one market insight with your AI analysis)

**Effect**: After 4 weeks of consistent series, your followers expect them. They come back to your profile every Monday/Thursday/Friday. That predictability compounds your reach.

### 3.3 Engagement Pod Strategy (Advanced)

For accounts under 1,500 followers, engagement pods dramatically accelerate growth.

**How it works**:
1. Create a private Telegram/WhatsApp group with 10-15 creators in your space (stock traders, fintech founders, investment analysts)
2. Each person posts their new thread in the group
3. Everyone in the pod likes + retweets + comments on each other's posts within first 30 minutes
4. This early engagement signals to the algorithm "this content is good" → algorithm shows it to more people
5. Result: Your engagement jumps 3-5x, reach multiplies

**Real example**: Lovable uses this. They found that threads that got 10+ likes in the first hour had 5x better final reach than threads that got 10 likes spread across 2 hours.

**How to recruit for your pod**:
- DM 10-15 accounts with 500-10K followers in your niche
- Message: "I'm building an engagement pod for fintech/stock analysis accounts. 10-15 of us commit to engaging on each other's posts in the first 30 minutes. No follow-for-follow, just mutual amplification. Interested?"
- Typical response rate: 40-50% yes

**Rules for your pod**:
- Only engage within 30 minutes of a post (after that, less algorithm value)
- Real engagement only (no low-effort "great post!" comments)
- Each person posts once per day max
- If someone doesn't engage 3 times in a row, they're out

## Phase 4: Retention and Community Building (100-500 Followers)

### 4.1 The Three-List Engagement System

Since most of your followers won't see your tweets organically (algorithms favor accounts with 1K+ followers), leverage THEIR audiences.

**Create three lists in Twitter**:

**List 1: "Micro-Influencers to Engage"** (200-500 accounts)
- Accounts with 1K-10K followers in finance/stocks
- Filter: only accounts with >2% engagement rate
- Action: Reply to their tweets 3-4x per week
- Goal: Get 50-100 of them to notice you, eventually follow back

**List 2: "Bigger Voices"** (50-100 accounts)
- Accounts with 10K-100K followers (established traders, fund managers, journalists)
- Action: Reply thoughtfully 1-2x per week (not spammy)
- Goal: 10-20 of them eventually retweet your content to their audiences

**List 3: "Competitors and Complementary Tools"** (30-50 accounts)
- Other fintech products, investment apps, analysis tools
- Action: Engage, but also look for collaboration opportunities
- Goal: Cross-promote, feature each other in newsletters, joint Twitter Spaces

**Daily ritual using these lists**:
- Morning: Spend 10 minutes replying to 5 posts from List 1
- Afternoon: Reply to 1 post from List 2
- Weekly: Reach out to 1 account from List 3 for collaboration

### 4.2 Direct Message Strategy (Without Being Spammy)

Only DM people after you've engaged with their content 3+ times. Template:

**Template 1 (Genuine Connection)**:
"Hi [name], been following your takes on [specific topic]. Really appreciated your thread on [specific insight]. We're building [product] to automate exactly what you were talking about. Early access link in bio—zero pressure, just thought you'd find it useful."

**Template 2 (Collaboration)**:
"Hey [name], your audience and our beta users have a ton of overlap. Would be valuable to cross-promote—feature each other in newsletters, do a Twitter Space together, whatever works for you. Interested in chatting?"

**Template 3 (Feedback Request)**:
"[name], you're one of the few people really thinking deeply about [topic]. We just launched [product], and would love your honest feedback. 5 minutes, no strings attached. Worth 10 mins of your time?"

**Key rules**:
- Always reference something specific they tweeted (shows you're not mass DM-ing)
- Keep it 2-3 sentences max
- Add value or ask for specific feedback (don't just ask them to try your product)
- Send from your personal founder account (higher response rate than brand account)

### 4.3 Twitter Spaces Strategy

Host 1 Twitter Space every 2 weeks. This builds community at scale.

**Format that works for financial AI**:

**"AI and Stock Analysis" Twitter Space** (1 hour, 2x per month)
- Invite: 3-5 early beta users who found real value
- Invite: 2-3 micro-influencers from your engagement lists
- Format:
  - First 10 min: Your intro—what you've learned from beta users
  - Next 40 min: Users share their stories, questions, what they use your product for
  - Last 10 min: Q&A from audience
- Recording: Save the audio, excerpt into TikTok/YouTube clips
- Follow-up: Link to full Space in all your tweets for the next 2 weeks

**Why this works**:
- 1 Space reaches 200-1K live listeners
- Those listeners become advocates (they invested 1 hour into you)
- Recordings get 2-3x more views than live (people catch it later)
- Each person you feature in the Space becomes an advocate (they tell their networks: "I was on this Space!")

## Phase 5: Metrics Dashboard and Weekly Reviews

### 5.1 What to Track (The Only Metrics That Matter)

**Daily Metrics** (takes 2 minutes to check):
- New followers (goal: 2-5/day at 100-300 followers; 5-15/day at 300-1K)
- Impressions (goal: 10K-20K at under 500 followers; 30K-80K at 500-1K)
- Total engagements (likes + retweets + replies)

**Weekly Metrics** (Friday review):
- Engagement rate (average) - target 1.5-3%
- Link clicks to landing page
- DMs received
- New partnerships/collaboration requests
- Beta signups from Twitter

**Monthly Metrics** (month-end review):
- Total follower growth (target: 30-50% month-on-month in first 6 months)
- Retention rate (what % of followers from 30 days ago are still following?)
- Email list growth from Twitter
- Estimated revenue impact (how many customers came from Twitter in month?)

### 5.2 The Weekly Review Template

Every Friday, 45 minutes:

**1. Celebrate Wins (5 min)**
- What was our best tweet this week? (Screenshot it)
- How many new followers? (Celebrate the number)
- Any customer wins from Twitter? (Note them)

**2. Analyze Top Performers (15 min)**
- Sort all tweets from the week by engagement
- Find the top 3
- For each one, document:
  - Hook (how did it start?)
  - Topic (which pillar?)
  - Format (thread, single, poll?)
  - Engagement rate
  - Reach
  - What made it work?

**3. Identify Flops (10 min)**
- Find bottom 3 performing tweets
- What went wrong?
  - Wrong topic?
  - Bad timing?
  - Weak hook?
  - Low-value content?

**4. Extract Patterns (10 min)**
- Look for repeating success patterns:
  - "Threads about [X topic] with [Y hook] get 2x engagement"
  - "Posts at [time] outperform [other time] by 30%"
  - "Case study posts get [engagement rate], education posts get [rate]"

**5. Plan Next Week (5 min)**
- Based on patterns, plan 20 tweets for next week
- Schedule them in Buffer
- Identify your 1-2 "hero posts" (the ones you'll put extra energy into)

## Phase 6: Scaling From 1,000+ Followers

### 6.1 What Changes After 1,000 Followers

Once you hit 1K, the game shifts:

| At 300 Followers | At 1,000+ Followers |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Engagement is most important | Consistency matters more |
| Commenting > Your own posts | Your posts get organic reach |
| You engage 2-3 hours/day | You engage 30-60 min/day |
| Post 3-5x/day | Post 2-3x/day (quality over volume) |
| Manual commenting is essential | Can use automation partially |
| Micro-influencers notice you | Larger accounts start engaging |
| Goal: Quality > Quantity | Goal: Consistency > Chasing virality |

### 6.2 Post-1K Growth Operations

**Daily Operations** (now 45-60 minutes instead of 90):

**Morning (10 min)**:
- Check overnight replies/DMs (respond within 60 minutes)
- Engage with 3 accounts from your Lists

**Midday (5 min)**:
- Publish scheduled tweet
- Check if it's performing well after first 30 minutes

**Afternoon (10 min)**:
- Reply to comments on your tweet
- Engage with 2-3 accounts

**Evening (10 min)**:
- Retweet 2-3 valuable pieces of content + your insight
- Check for collaboration DMs

**Weekly (2-3 hours)**:
- Content planning
- Analytics review
- Twitter Space or newsletter (if building parallel channels)

---

## Phase 7: Advanced Tactics for Compound Growth (500-2,000+ Followers)

### 7.1 Email Newsletter Integration

After each viral tweet/thread, capture followers into your email list:

**In-thread CTA**:
"Join 500+ traders who get my best analysis in your inbox every Friday. Get early access to new features and market insights before they hit Twitter: [newsletter link]"

**Result**: 2-5% of thread readers subscribe. A thread with 50K views = 1,000-2,500 new newsletter subscribers = email list becomes your sustainable growth channel (less dependent on Twitter algorithm).

### 7.2 Product Launch Coordination

Time your Twitter growth with product feature launches:

**Week 1**: Build anticipation
- "We just shipped something investors have been asking for..."
- Tease what's coming without revealing everything

**Week 2**: Launch
- Full product announcement thread
- Demo video
- Customer testimonials

**Week 3**: Amplify
- Case study from power user
- How-to content
- Behind-the-scenes of the build

**Result**: Coordinated pushes create 3-5x more follower growth than scattered posting.

### 7.3 Founder Positioning vs. Brand Account

**When you're under 1K followers**: Focus on founder account
- Investors follow people, not companies
- Founders have personality, relatability
- Easier to build trust

**After 1K followers**: Dual strategy
- Founder account: Thought leadership, contrarian takes, personal brand
- Brand account: Product announcements, case studies, company-specific wins
- Cross-promote both

**Lovable's approach**: Anton (founder) has 64K followers and posts contrarian takes like "Web development is broken" → high engagement → retweets show it in Lovable (brand) feed → new users arrive at brand account.

## Phase 8: Crisis and Issue Management

### 8.1 Response Protocols

**If a customer complains publicly**:
- Reply within 30 minutes
- Acknowledge the issue
- Move to DM for details ("Sorry to hear this. Let's fix it. Shooting you a DM.")
- Solve in private, close in public

**If a competitor attacks you**:
- Don't engage emotionally
- Either ignore or respond with data
- Example: "We see this differently. Here's why [your approach works better]: [specific data]"

**If a tweet flops**:
- Don't delete it
- Reply with a reframe: "Most people see this wrong. Here's what actually matters..."
- Use it as a learning moment

## Avoiding Common Post-Launch Mistakes

### ❌ **DO NOT**:

1. **Abandon your account after launch week**
   - Most products die at Week 3 because founder gets busy
   - Consistency beats intensity

2. **Post and disappear** (not engaging)
   - 80% of growth comes from engagement, not your own tweets
   - If you don't engage, followers unfollow

3. **Copy competitor accounts exactly**
   - Your voice is your differentiation
   - Be authentically you

4. **Delete underperforming tweets**
   - Keep them, learn from them
   - Deleting tweets signals insecurity

5. **Use bot-like language**
   - "We're excited to announce..." is death on Twitter
   - Be human, be specific, be real

6. **Chase every trend**
   - Stick to your 3-5 content pillars
   - Consistency > chasing viral moments

7. **Over-automate engagement**
   - AI can help schedule tweets, but replies must be human
   - People follow people, not bots

8. **Ignore DMs**
   - Every DM is a potential customer or partner
   - Reply within 60-90 minutes always

## Conclusion: The Compound Growth Machine

Post-launch Twitter success isn't about hacks or going viral repeatedly. It's about building **systematic, predictable engagement** that compounds month after month.

The playbook:
1. **Create** valuable content daily (30 minutes)
2. **Engage** authentically with your community (30 minutes)
3. **Analyze** what works (45 minutes/week)
4. **Repeat** and refine

Lovable grew from 0 to 176K followers because they did this religiously. Cursor became 1M+ DAU for the same reason.

If you stick to this operational framework for 90 days—posting daily, engaging authentically, reviewing metrics weekly—you'll hit 1,000 followers. More importantly, you'll have built an audience of genuine believers in your product who will become your best evangelists.

The Twitter account is not the endgame. It's the distribution channel for your actual business. Every follower should eventually become a customer. Twitter is just the fastest, cheapest way to reach them at scale.

Stay consistent. Stay authentic. Let the compounding begin.
