To name your website, we should look at the trajectory of "Agentic" platforms. In 2023-2024, the trend was focused on *inputs* (Prompts). In 2025 and beyond, the trend is moving toward *structured outcomes* (Kits/Workflows).

The names below are designed to bridge the gap between **GitHub's utility** (reliable, technical) and **Modern SaaS** (approachable, colorful) to attract your diverse audience of developers, marketers, and PMs.

### **Part 1: Market Analysis (The 2023-2024 "Prompt Era")**
Before listing the new names, here is the analysis of the successful platforms you mentioned. They followed three distinct naming patterns:
1.  **The "Repository" Pattern:** Names like **PromptBase**, **PromptHero**, and **PromptLibrary** promised a massive, searchable database. *Psychology: "I can find anything here."*
2.  **The "Action" Pattern:** Names like **FlowGPT**, **SnackPrompt**, and **AgentGPT** focused on movement, speed, and execution. *Psychology: "This makes me work faster."*
3.  **The "Community" Pattern:** Names like **Hugging Face** (not prompt-specific but relevant) or **Discord communities** used abstract or fun terms to build a tribe.

**Your Opportunity:**
Your website isn't just a "database" (Base) or a "chat" (Flow). It is a **toolbox**. It provides the *essential equipment* to do a job. Therefore, the word "Kit" is perfect—it implies completeness.

### **Part 2: 30 Names for Your "Job Kit" Platform**
I have categorized these into "Vibes" so you can match the name to the exact feeling you want the website to have.

#### **Category A: The "Hub" Style (Trust & Authority)**
*Best for: Establishing the site as the #1 central library. Similar to "PromptBase" or "GitHub".*

1.  **KitBase** (Classic, reliable, easy to remember)
2.  **KitHub** (Direct nod to GitHub, but for Kits)
3.  **KitHunt** (Exciting, implies discovery like ProductHunt)
4.  **KitVault** (Implies high-value, premium content)
5.  **KitLab** (Implies experimentation and science)
6.  **KitSpace** (Friendly, open, community-driven)
7.  **OpenKit** (Strong open-source ethos)

#### **Category B: The "Geek" Style (Developer Appeal)**
*Best for: Attracting the coders who will likely build the initial kits. Uses terminology from gaming and coding.*

8.  **KitBash** (*Strong Contender:* In model making/3D, "kitbashing" means taking pieces from different kits to make something new. Perfect metaphor.)
9.  **RepoKit** (Connects directly to "Repository")
10. **GitKit** (Short, punchy, very tech-focused)
11. **StackKit** (References "Tech Stack")
12. **SpecKits** (Direct reference to the underlying tech, straightforward)
13. **CodeKit** (Simple, but maybe too developer-focused?)
14. **KitOps** (Plays on "DevOps"—implies operational efficiency)

#### **Category C: The "Flow" Style (Action & Productivity)**
*Best for: Project Managers and Lawyers who care about "getting things done."*

15. **KitFlow** (Smooth, implies the kit helps you move forward)
16. **KitRun** (Execute the job immediately)
17. **JobKit** (Very literal. "Here is your kit for the job.")
18. **LaunchKit** (Perfect for the "Startup Founder" persona)
19. **WorkKit** (Broad appeal for general professionals)
20. **ReadyKit** (Implies the agent is ready to go)
21. **TaskKit** (Focuses on the `tasks.md` aspect)

#### **Category D: The "Pop" Style (Marketing & Design Appeal)**
*Best for: Using "interesting colors and elements" to attract non-coders. These sound like trendy startups.*

22. **KitPop** (Fun, colorful, catchy)
23. **KitVibe** (Modern, Gen-Z appeal)
24. **KitMode** ("Get in the zone/mode")
25. **SuperKit** (Playful, aspirational)
26. **WonderKit** (Appeals to curiosity)
27. **KitCast** (Implies broadcasting or sharing)
28. **ZenKit** (Implies the kit brings order to chaos)

#### **Category E: The "Abstract" Style**
*Best for: Building a unique brand that doesn't mean anything specific but sounds good.*

29. **Kitify** (The act of turning a job into a kit)
30. **Kitsune** (Japanese for "Fox"—clever, smart agent. A "mascot" opportunity like GitHub's Octocat.)

### **Part 3: Top 3 Recommendations**

If I were building this to bridge the "Geek" and "Professional" worlds, here are my top picks:

**1. KitBash (.com or .io)**
*   **Why:** It is a term deeply rooted in "maker culture" (combining parts to make cool stuff). It fits the GitHub/Geek vibe perfectly but sounds cool enough for a creative director. It implies *creativity*, not just downloading files.
*   **Vibe:** Dark mode, neon accents, "Builder" energy.

**2. KitHunt**
*   **Why:** It borrows the familiar mechanism of "ProductHunt." Users know exactly what to do: browse, upvote, and download. It creates a daily habit ("What's the top Kit today?").
*   **Vibe:** White/Orange (like YCombinator/ProductHunt), very clean, list-heavy.

**3. JobKit**
*   **Why:** It is the most "mainstream" friendly. A lawyer doesn't know what a "repo" is, but they know what a "Job" is. "Here is the kit to do your job." It’s the "Professional LinkedIn" version of the site.
*   **Vibe:** Professional blue/grey, clean typography, focus on "ROI" and "Efficiency."
