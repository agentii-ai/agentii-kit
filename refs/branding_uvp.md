Data — Built for the Way Analysts Actually Work
Unify public info and proprietary incremental data into one harmonized layer. The system captures signals from reports, transcripts, spreadsheets, interviews, and videos—automatically time-stamped, contextualized, and ranked for relevance.
 Work seamlessly across structured to fully unstructured sources with native parsers and entity-linking that eliminate most manual prep work and convert messy inputs into analysis-ready context in seconds.
 Fuzzy-tolerant retrieval understands industry nuance and terminology while tracing every fact back to its verified source, ensuring auditability, data lineage, and confidence in every insight.


Agentic Analytics - Delegate the Analysis, Keep the Judgment
- Human-Like Iterative Search & Reasoning
The system approaches each question like a senior analyst—breaking it down, searching intelligently, extracting the right data, checking the math, and refining until the answer is clear, consistent, and defensible. It runs multiple rounds of tool calls with self-correction, refining queries and calculations until the answer is consistent, explained, and decision-ready.
- Building the Map: Context-Aware Financial Intelligence 
Every interaction enriches a structured understanding of companies, timelines, entities, and schema awareness, and search provenance. This context backbone  enables reliable multi-step financial reasoning, not just isolated answers.
- A Finance-Native Agent Tool Stack Under the Hood
Combines sparse + dense retrieval, table extractors, SQL generators, news APIs, and multi-modal parsing to deliver answers—not just documents.
- Multi-Agent Orchestration for Problem Solving
Planner, Retriever, Extractor, Verifier, and Synthesizer Agents coordinate in real time to produce clear, trustworthy outputs.



Smart Synthesis — Turn Inputs Into Insightful Narratives & Visuals
- Instant Multi-Document Synthesis into Customized Dashboards 
 Combine insights across documents and datasets into crisp narratives, summaries, or visual panels—with seamless text ↔ visual switching for IC meetings, portfolio reviews, or LP materials.
- Interactive Dashboards (Tableau-Style)
 Generate dynamic, analysis-ready dashboards from any data source. Explore trends, KPIs, and comps through intuitive charts and tables that support fast, informed decisions.
