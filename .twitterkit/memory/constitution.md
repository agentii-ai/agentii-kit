## Preamble: Twitter as Growth-Hacking Infrastructure

This constitution governs the **Agentii Dual-Twitter Program**: (1) @agentii_ai - product authority for institutional investment research with agentic intelligence, and (2) @frank_agentii - founder-led growth-hacking via open-source spec-driven kits and developer education. Both accounts are specialized Twitter presences that demonstrate how to create domain-specific growth strategies while maintaining full compatibility with blog-driven content marketing.

### Why Twitter for AI SaaS Financial Products (2024-2025)

**Critical Context**: In the 2024-2025 landscape, Twitter (X) has evolved from a broadcast channel into the **primary arena for AI SaaS companies to battle for mindshare**, establish market-defining narratives, and build defensible moats through community and authenticity.

**Platform Advantages**:
1. **Zero-cost distribution** to exactly your target audience (VCs, prosumer investors, developers)
2. **Real-time validation** of product positioning and messaging
3. **Presales channel** before official product launch (waitlist building, beta signups)
4. **Founder-to-investor connection** at scale without cold emails
5. **Thought leadership platform** that compounds over time
6. **Customer testimonial factory** as your customer base grows

**Evidence from Recent Launches**:
- **Cursor**: $9.9B valuation, $200M ARR—launched via Twitter with founder-led "build in public" narrative
- **Harvey AI**: $100M ARR in 3 years—Twitter strategy centered on manufactured scarcity and institutional credibility
- **Lovable**: $100M ARR in 8 months—dual-account strategy (founder + product) created compound growth
- **HeyGen, Runway, Pika**: Viral demos on Twitter drove user acquisition at 10x lower CAC than paid ads

**Key Shift**: The most heated and impactful conversations are not about individual features, but about **competing visions for the future of work**. Success on Twitter means winning the argument for your workflow philosophy.

## I. Foundation: Twitter Marketing Principles for AI SaaS Financial Products

### Principle 1.1: Founder-Led Marketing Over Corporate Accounts

**Principle**: Users and investors are bypassing polished brand accounts to engage directly with founders. A founder's personal account is a strategic asset for sharing vision, demonstrating product velocity, and building an authentic narrative that resonates more deeply than corporate marketing.

**Application**:
- **@frank_agentii** carries founder voice—vulnerable, controversial takes on finance/AI, behind-the-scenes insights
- **@agentii_ai** maintains professional authority but with occasional personality (not robotic corporate speak)
- Founder account gets 60% authentic founder content, 25% product passion, 15% personal wins/failures
- Product account gets 50% educational (stock analysis tips), 30% product updates, 20% engagement/community

**Rationale**: Lovable's dual-account strategy (founder @antonosika + product @lovable_dev) created 70-120K follower compound effect. The product account builds institutional credibility; the founder account humanizes the company and drives viral moments.

**Test**: Founder tweets outperform product tweets by 2-4x on engagement rate. Personal vulnerability builds trust that converts to product adoption.

### Principle 1.2: "Show, Don't Tell" with Irrefutable Demos

**Principle**: For AI, a compelling demo is the ultimate marketing asset. The most effective content is not an explanation of what your product does, but a **visual demonstration of it in action**.

**Application**:
- **@agentii_ai**: Weekly product demos showing stock analysis in action (15-30 second screen recordings)
  - Before/after workflow time comparisons ("What took 3 hours now takes 18 minutes")
  - Real stock analysis breakdowns (e.g., "$TSLA analysis—watch how we spot what most analysts miss")
  - Visual proof of AI catching inflection points 2-5 days before market reacts
- **@frank_agentii**: Technical deep-dives showing how spec-driven kits work
  - Live coding demos of agent orchestration patterns
  - GitHub repo walkthroughs with real code examples
  - Behind-the-scenes: "How we built agentii.ai's financial agent"

**Rationale**: For creative tools like Runway and Pika, visual proof cuts through the noise and hype. For developer tools like Devin, it's a screen recording of the agent completing a complex coding task autonomously. Visual demonstrations get 10x more engagement than text-only tweets.

**Test**: Every major product announcement includes a video demo. Threads without visual proof are rejected or revised.

### Principle 1.3: Build in Public—Transparency + Velocity

**Principle**: The era of stealth launches is over. The new frontier is sharing your building journey authentically: progress updates, feature iterations, honest failures, community feedback loops.

**Application**:
- **@frank_agentii**: Weekly "build in public" updates
  - "Just shipped X feature after 2 weeks of development"
  - "Found a bug affecting 10% of users, here's how we fixed it"
  - "Realized we were wrong about Y, here's what we learned"
  - Open-source kit progress (GitHub stars trajectory, adoption metrics)
- **@agentii_ai**: Product iteration transparency
  - "Based on feedback from 500+ users, we're restructuring pricing"
  - Weekly accuracy reports (win rates, confidence scores, transparency over hiding problems)
  - Feature request voting (public Airtable or GitHub Issues board)

**Rationale**: Transparency builds trust. Manus AI generated massive traction through "build in public" narrative—daily capability demonstrations week after launch. Users feel ownership in company success.

**Test**: 1-2 "build in public" posts weekly minimum. Community feedback loops must be public and actioned.

### Principle 1.4: Problem-First, Not Technology-First

**Principle**: The most heated conversations on Twitter are about solving painful, specific bottlenecks—not about how clever your tech stack is. Successful companies anchor their entire Twitter narrative around **one excruciatingly painful bottleneck**.

**Application**:
- **@agentii_ai**: Focus on investor pain points first
  - "Analyzing 500 earnings calls manually takes 40+ hours. Here's how AI cuts that to 3 minutes"
  - "The gap between retail investor tools and Wall Street AI is closing. Here's why that matters"
  - "Most analysts spend 3+ hours on research despite having tools. We're fixing this"
- **@frank_agentii**: Focus on developer/founder pain points
  - "95% of corporate gen-AI pilots fail. Here's the single bottleneck they miss"
  - "Why most AI tools fail at financial research (and how to fix it)"
  - "Building agents is hard. Here's the framework that works"

**Rationale**: Harvey AI initially focused exclusively on building highly custom models for the complex research needs of large law firms, ignoring broader applications. This focus gave them a clear, defensible position and a compelling story to tell. A study of 150 AI deployments found that 95% of corporate gen-AI pilots fail because companies chase flashy top-down "AI transformation" projects instead of focusing on a single painful bottleneck.

**Test**: Every product announcement must articulate the specific problem solved. No feature lists without problem context.

### Principle 1.5: Narrative & Philosophy—Sell a Better Way of Working

**Principle**: Choose your narrative: Incremental vs. Revolutionary. Your Twitter strategy must reflect your product's adoption curve and communicate a **workflow philosophy**, not just features.

**Application**:
- **@agentii_ai**: Incremental narrative (the "Cursor" model for financial professionals)
  - "AI-powered upgrade to your existing investment research workflow"
  - "Seamless integration with Bloomberg, FactSet, and tools you already use"
  - "Amplifies human judgment (not replaces it)"
  - Makes adoption feel low-risk and intuitive
- **@frank_agentii**: Revolutionary narrative (the "Devin" model for agentic systems)
  - "Spec-driven development is the future of building AI products"
  - "This is the first time developers can systematically build reliable agents"
  - "Open-source kits that change how you think about product development"
  - High-risk, high-reward narrative generates immense initial buzz

**Rationale**: Cursor achieved rapid, widespread adoption by positioning itself as a seamless, AI-powered upgrade to an existing, beloved workflow (VS Code). Devin is framed as a radical leap—the world's first AI software engineer. Both narratives work, but for different adoption curves.

**Test**: Messaging audit quarterly. Are we communicating workflow philosophy or just listing features? Adjust if drifting toward feature dumps.

### Principle 1.6: Scaled Authenticity > Mass Automation

**Principle**: The era of spammy follow bots and generic DMs is over. The new frontier is using AI-powered tools to achieve **"scaled authenticity"**—hyper-specific audience targeting and drafting genuinely helpful, non-promotional replies that a human can approve and post.

**Application**:
- **"Slow Growth" Cadence** (mimic human behavior):
  - Follows: 20-30 people per day (maximum)
  - Replies: 10-15 per day (maximum)
  - DMs: 5-10 per day (maximum)
- **"Helpful Agent" Workflow**:
  - Week 1: Identify 50-100 key people in your target niche
  - Weeks 2-4: Monitor their tweets for specific pain points and draft helpful, non-promotional replies
  - Manually approve and post each one (no automated posting without human review)
  - Goal: Build recognition and trust, not vanity followers

**Rationale**: Aggressive automation and engagement bait actively destroys brand reputation. Sophisticated users see through these tactics instantly. Best practices involve staying well under Twitter's rate limits to avoid being flagged as spam. This slow, consistent approach builds a foundation of genuine relationships, which is more valuable than a large, unengaged follower count.

**Test**: Reply quality > reply quantity. Every reply must add unique perspective or data, never generic praise. No automation without human approval.

## III. Core Principles for Twitter Content Strategy

### Principle 3.1: The 80/20 Rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Principle**: 80% of posts must provide genuine value; only 20% can be promotional. Critical for credibility with investors and prosumers.

**Application**:
- **Value-driven content types**:
  - Educational threads teaching financial concepts or spec-driven development
  - Data visualizations and market analysis
  - Industry problem identification
  - Genuine insights from domain expertise
  - Entertaining/relatable market or tech commentary
- **Promotional content that works**:
  - Feature announcements tied to specific customer problems
  - Beta invitations with clear value proposition
  - Case studies showing quantified results
  - Product demonstrations with compelling narratives

**Test**: Monthly content audit. If > 20% of posts are promotional, rebalance immediately. Quality of engagement > quantity of posts.

### Principle 3.2: Thread Mastery—The Highest-ROI Content Format

**Principle**: Threads consistently outperform all other Twitter formats for organic reach among B2B audiences. Mastering thread structure is non-negotiable.

**Viral Thread Formula**:
1. **Hook (Tweet 1)**: Starts with curiosity gap or bold statement
   - Examples: "I analyzed 500 earnings calls and found this one AI pattern every investor missed"
   - "Here's why most AI tools fail at financial research (and how to fix it)"
2. **Setup (Tweets 2-3)**: Establish problem or context, show why this matters
3. **Value Delivery (Tweets 4-10)**: Provide 1-5 concrete, actionable insights (numbered format: 1/, 2/, 3/)
4. **Proof/Social Proof (Tweet 11-12)**: Include metrics, customer results, benchmarks
5. **Call-to-Action (Final Tweet)**: "Follow for daily AI financial research insights" or "RT if you've faced this problem"

**Application**:
- **@agentii_ai**: 2 major threads per week (financial analysis deep-dives, product capability showcases)
- **@frank_agentii**: 1-2 major threads per week (spec-driven development lessons, founder journey narratives)
- Post threads at 8 AM ET (peak financial professional hours)
- Within 60 minutes: share to LinkedIn as carousel
- At 24-hour mark: quote tweet with new angle
- Convert to blog post within 48 hours (SEO and email list building)

**Test**: Threads must get 2x engagement rate of standalone tweets. If threads underperform, audit hook, value delivery, or CTA.

### Principle 3.3: Visual Content Multiplier Effect

**Principle**: Tweets with images get 2-4x more engagement than text-only tweets. Tweets with native video get 10x more engagement than links to external video hosting.

**Application**:
- **@agentii_ai**: Every product announcement includes screen recording (15-30 seconds max)
  - Before/after workflow time comparisons
  - Stock analysis breakdowns with annotated screenshots
  - Chart showing "AI predicted move 2 days before market reacted"
- **@frank_agentii**: Code demos, GitHub repo walkthroughs, architecture diagrams
  - Screen recordings of agent orchestration in action
  - Meme format with financial or AI twist (surprisingly effective B2B)
  - Data visualizations of adoption trends

**Test**: Standalone text tweets limited to 20% of total posts. Every major announcement includes visual proof.

### Principle 3.4: The "Reply Guy" Strategy—Systematic Authority Building

**Principle**: Most founders with 5K+ followers are buried in mentions but grateful for insightful replies. Their followers see your reply in their feed. This is one of most underutilized growth tactics.

**Application**:
- Spend 30 minutes daily finding high-engagement posts from 100-1M follower accounts in your niche
- Write 2-3 sentence replies that:
  - Show you deeply understood the original tweet
  - Add unique perspective or data
  - Ask follow-up question
  - Never mention your product
- Quality metrics: aim for replies that get 2-5% of the original tweet's engagement
- Target accounts:
  - **@agentii_ai**: Finance Twitter influencers, hedge fund analysts, fintech founders
  - **@frank_agentii**: Developer advocates, AI researchers, YC founders, VCs

**Rationale**: When 10,000 people see a 50K follower account engaging with your reply, you gain credibility without advertising. This creates visibility + credibility by association.

**Test**: 5-10 quality replies per day minimum. If replies get < 1% engagement of original tweet, improve reply quality or target different accounts.

### Principle 3.5: Engagement First, Broadcasting Second

**Principle**: Twitter is a conversation platform, not a megaphone. Engagement with other accounts drives 40-60% of early growth, not broadcasting your own content.

**Application**:
- Reserve 30 minutes daily for strategic engagement (separate from "reply guy" strategy)
- "50 comments daily" strategy targeting accounts in your niche
- Focus on accounts with 5,000-50,000 followers (sweet spot for engagement reciprocity)
- Search Twitter for keywords:
  - **@agentii_ai**: "financial analysis," "investment research," "fund manager," "equity research"
  - **@frank_agentii**: "agentic AI," "spec-driven," "agent orchestration," "startup growth"
- Write thoughtful replies adding unique perspective (not generic praise)
- When your comment generates views → profile visitors click through

**Test**: Reply to every comment on your posts within 2 hours (algorithm signals engagement). If engagement time drops below 30 min/day, growth stalls.

---

## IV. Cross-Account Strategy: Amplification Without Confusion

**Principle**: Both accounts serve agentii.ai's ultimate growth goal, but maintain distinct identities and target audiences to avoid confusion.

**Coordination Requirements**:

### 4.1 Audience Segmentation

- **@agentii_ai readers**: Professional investors first, technologists second
- **@frank_agentii readers**: Technologists first, potential product users second
- **Crossover readers**: Sophisticated investors who code OR technical founders interested in investing
- DO NOT force content to appeal to both simultaneously

### 4.2 Content Linking Strategy

- **@agentii_ai** posts may reference **@frank_agentii** posts when relevant to explain technical implementation
- **@frank_agentii** posts may mention **@agentii_ai** as "inspiration for why agentic systems matter"
- Cross-links happen naturally, not forced (max 1-2 per post)
- Same insights told from different angles ✅ (e.g., @agentii_ai: "How agents improve research speed", @frank_agentii: "Building reliable agent systems for financial analysis")
- Duplicate posts ❌ (Do not publish exact same content on both accounts)
- Shared data with different framing ✅ (e.g., @agentii_ai: "Market trends we discovered", @frank_agentii: "How we built the analysis tools")

### 4.3 Product Mention Protocol

- **@agentii_ai**: Agentii.ai product is the primary subject (case studies, use cases, product roadmap, feature announcements)
- **@frank_agentii**: Agentii-kit frameworks/kits are primary; agentii.ai mentioned as strategic reference
- Both accounts: "Agentic systems" as philosophical framework, not product promo

### 4.4 Launch Coordination

When launching major features or products:
1. **@frank_agentii** teases technical implementation 1-2 days before launch ("Building in public: Here's what we're shipping Tuesday")
2. **@agentii_ai** announces product launch simultaneously with founder account
3. Both accounts tag each other in launch threads
4. Founder account shares vulnerability/behind-the-scenes; product account shares customer value
5. Coordinate with blog releases (blog.agentii.ai and kits.agentii.ai publish supporting content same day)

**Example Launch Sequence**:
- **Monday (T-1)**: @frank_agentii posts "build in public" thread teasing launch
- **Tuesday 8 AM (T-0)**: @agentii_ai posts major launch thread (15-20 tweets) covering problem, solution, pricing, CTA
- **Tuesday 8:10 AM (T+10 min)**: @frank_agentii posts founder narrative thread (why we built this, biggest mistakes, lessons learned)
- **Tuesday 12 PM (T+4 hours)**: Both accounts share blog posts (blog.agentii.ai and kits.agentii.ai)
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Both accounts respond to EVERY comment within 30 minutes
- **Friday**: Both accounts share customer testimonials and early results

### 4.5 Newsletter & Social Strategy

- Separate email lists and social accounts (different value propositions)
- **@agentii_ai**: Investment research, market analysis, agentic insights, product updates
- **@frank_agentii**: Developer tutorials, spec-kit patterns, growth-hacking lessons, founder stories
- Consider newsletter cross-promotion (e.g., kits.agentii.ai newsletter mentions "investors should read blog.agentii.ai")

### 6.3 Financial Rigor Requirements (for @agentii_ai)

All investment analysis must meet institutional research standards:
- **Thesis Clarity**: Investment theses must be explicit (bullish, bearish, neutral) with clear conviction levels
- **Data-Driven Analysis**: Use SEC filings, earnings calls, public financial data as primary sources
- **Time Horizons**: Specify investment thesis timeframe (3-month, 1-year, 3-year, 5-year+)
- **Risk Acknowledgment**: Mandatory section addressing downside risks, market conditions where thesis breaks
- **Disclosure Requirements**:
  - Author disclosure: Any personal holdings mentioned
  - Conflicts of interest: Relationships with companies discussed
  - Methodology: How analysis differs from consensus, what unique insights you bring
  - Timestamp: Content decay notice (e.g., "Analysis assumes Q3 2025 market conditions")

**Prohibited**:
- ❌ Market-timing calls without multi-scenario analysis
- ❌ "Can't miss" or "sure thing" language
- ❌ Unnamed sources ("industry insiders tell us...")
- ❌ Extrapolating single-quarter results to annual/multi-year trends

### 6.4 Authentic Founder Voice Requirements (for @frank_agentii)

Content must reflect real, hard-won lessons from building and shipping products:
- **Specificity Over Generalization**: Avoid "best practices"—describe exactly what worked in specific context
- **Failure Case Inclusion**: Every post about "how we did X" includes section on "what we tried that didn't work"
- **Numbers & Metrics**: Share actual data (velocity, adoption rates, GitHub stars trajectory, CAC) not just anecdotes
- **Shipping Evidence**: Code examples, GitHub repos, production deployments—prove you've built what you're writing about
- **Audience Respect**: Don't oversell; acknowledge that not all tactics work for all teams/products

**Prohibited**:
- ❌ Survivorship bias ("successful founders all do X")
- ❌ Generic advice without personal validation
- ❌ "Move fast and break things" without addressing the cost of breakage
- ❌ Treating founders/engineers as passive recipients instead of creative peers

## IX. Constraints & Boundaries

### 9.1 What NOT to Do (Anti-Patterns)

**Content Mistakes**:
- ❌ Over-Promotional Content (posting too many product pitches—more than 20% of content)
- ❌ Generic Financial Content (sharing generic market commentary like "Market up 2% today")
- ❌ Inconsistent Posting (posting 3x daily Monday, then silent for 4 days)
- ❌ Ignoring Conversations (publishing content but not engaging responses)

**Growth Mistakes**:
- ❌ Buying Followers (purchasing bot follower packages to inflate numbers)
- ❌ Starting DMs Too Early (messaging at 50 followers or without clear positioning)
- ❌ Following-Back Every Account (appearing desperate by following back everyone)
- ❌ Forgetting the 80/20 Rule (all entertaining content, no value OR all promotional, no engagement)

**Launch Mistakes**:
- ❌ Launching Without Audience (announcing product with 200 followers)
- ❌ Single-Channel Launch (only announcing on Twitter without email, LinkedIn, blog coordination)
- ❌ Over-Promising and Under-Delivering (exaggerating product capabilities in hype-filled AI space)

### 9.2 Scope Discipline

**In Scope** for this Twitter strategy:
- Twitter/X marketing strategy and operations for agentii.ai product and agentii-kit frameworks
- Content planning, creation, and scheduling
- Community building and engagement
- Growth loops and viral mechanics
- Product-led growth via Twitter
- Metrics and analytics for activation/retention/growth

**Out of Scope**:
- Product implementation (use spec-kit for that)
- General product management (use pm-kit)
- Non-Twitter marketing channels (create dedicated strategies or use marketing-kit)

---

## X. Quality Standards & Governance

### 10.1 Evidence-Based Content

All content must be grounded in:
1. **Recent case studies** (2023–2025) from successful AI SaaS products (Cursor, Harvey, Lovable, HeyGen, Runway, Pika, Manus, Hebbia, Genspark)
2. **Public research** and playbooks (referenced with links in refs/twit-refs/)
3. **First-principles reasoning** about social platforms, growth loops, and creator economies

**Anti-pattern**: Generic startup advice or "10 tips for Twitter growth" content without domain specificity.

### 10.2 Actionable Over Theoretical

Every tweet, thread, and campaign must be:
- **Concrete**: Specific enough to execute without interpretation
- **Measurable**: Tied to metrics that can be tracked
- **Time-bound**: Clear on cadence (daily, weekly, per-sprint)

**Anti-pattern**: Vague aspirations like "increase engagement" without defining what engagement means or how to measure it.

### 10.3 Constitution-Driven Development

Just as spec-kit enforces TDD and architecture principles, twitter-kit enforces **Twitter marketing principles** derived from successful AI SaaS products:

- All content must demonstrate "show, don't tell"
- All content must align with founder-led, authentic voice
- All tactics must connect to measurable activation or retention
- No growth hacking that sacrifices trust or brand reputation

**Governance**: The `/twitterkit.constitution` command should be run **first** to establish these principles before any spec or plan is created.

### 10.4 Review Checklist

Before publishing major content:
- [ ] Content aligns with account-specific content pillars
- [ ] 80/20 rule maintained (value > promotion)
- [ ] Visual proof included (screenshot, video, or data viz)
- [ ] Engagement plan ready (30 min reserved for replies within 2 hours)
- [ ] UTM parameters added to all links
- [ ] Cross-promotion coordinated (other account, blog, newsletter)
- [ ] Financial rigor requirements met (@agentii_ai only)
- [ ] Founder authenticity requirements met (@frank_agentii only)
